# Claude

Busy hooks verified 2026-07-28 on Claude Code 2.1.220.

## Operating facts

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Busy | Owned hooks: `UserPromptSubmit` opens while `Stop`, `StopFailure`, and `SessionEnd` close; manual interrupt emits no hook, so control reports delivered keys and live endpoint only, publishes no idle event or cancellation claim, and usually leaves `claude-hook` busy. |
| Exit | `/exit`. |
| Interrupt | Single Escape. |
| Skill | `/<skill>`, for example `/no-mistakes`. |
| Model | `--model <model>`; discover through the interactive `/model` picker, with alias or full-name shape documented by `claude --help`. |
| Effort | `--effort <low\|medium\|high\|xhigh\|max>`, verified on 2.1.196. |
| Permissions | `--dangerously-skip-permissions` by default, or `--permission-mode auto` when `config/claude-permission-mode` is `auto`; the `auto` shape verified on 2.1.269, and `../../../../../docs/configuration.md` "Claude permission mode" owns the file. |

## Workspace trust

Claude gates a folder it has never seen behind an interactive workspace-trust dialog (titled "Quick safety check: Is this a project you created or one you trust?"), so every fresh task worktree would hit it, and so would every secondmate home no operator has opened by hand.
`--dangerously-skip-permissions` does not cover that gate: `claude --help` records that the dialog is skipped only in non-interactive mode, through `-p` or a non-TTY stdout, and a spawned pane is interactive.
Every claude spawn therefore pre-registers the directory its pane starts in before launch, and the dialog does not appear: the task worktree for a ship or scout, and the home itself for a `--secondmate` spawn, in either seeded shape (a leased worktree or a standalone clone).

A second, separate dialog - "Allow external CLAUDE.md file imports?" - renders whenever a loaded CLAUDE.md chain reaches outside the project tree, which every crewmate's does through the captain's own `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` importing `~/.claude/RTK.md`.
`--setting-sources project,local` (the minimal worker tool surface) does not suppress it either, and it gates the pane exactly like the trust dialog: cursor on "No, disable external imports", no way to move the selection from firstmate's steering plane.

`../../../bin/fm-claude-trust.sh` records `hasTrustDialogAccepted` for both the worktree and its primary checkout in `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME}/.claude.json` for a ship or scout spawn; a secondmate spawn registers only its own home entry, since a secondmate home has no separate primary-checkout entry to carry import consent forward from.
For a ship or scout spawn, the external-imports flags (`hasClaudeMdExternalIncludesApproved`, `hasClaudeMdExternalIncludesWarningShown`) are carried forward alongside the trust flag only when the primary checkout's project entry already carries an explicit `hasClaudeMdExternalIncludesApproved===true` from a prior interactive session - the common first-spawn case is a project claude has never been asked about, so those two flags are left unwritten and the import dialog still renders, even though trust registers normally.
When the project entry instead already carries an explicit decline (`===false`), the whole registration refuses - including the trust flag - rather than manufacture consent the human never gave, so that spawn wedges on the trust dialog before it would even reach the import one.
The why-two-entries mechanism and the consent-gating logic live in the script's own header comment, which is the one owner for that contract; the fact worth repeating here is that `../../../bin/fm-spawn.sh` refuses the spawn when the trust flag fails to land, rather than launching a worker that would wedge on that dialog.

Never try to answer either dialog with a key.
Firstmate's key plane carries only Enter, Escape, and C-c with no arrow navigation, so it cannot move a dialog's selection at all, and both dialogs render with the cursor on their declining option, which means a sent Enter ends the session instead of accepting.
A visible trust dialog means pre-registration did not take effect (or the project entry already carries an explicit decline) - inspect the store and the spawn's error output rather than sending keys.
A visible external-imports dialog is expected, not a failure signal, whenever the project entry has no prior explicit approval on record - the common first-spawn case; `fm-control.sh <id> interrupt` delivers Escape, which dismisses whichever of the two is on screen without answering it, and is the safe way to clear a wedged pane for inspection.

The once-per-machine bypass-permissions confirmation is a third, separate dialog, scoped to the machine rather than the path, and pre-registration does not address it.
Never send Enter to that one either: it was observed rendering in the same shape as the trust dialog, with the selection on `No, exit` and the footer `Enter to confirm . Esc to cancel`, so Enter ends the session rather than accepting.
Firstmate cannot move a selection with Enter, Escape, and C-c alone, so it cannot accept this dialog at all, and an operator accepts it once per machine instead.
Inspect the pane to identify which dialog is on screen, and report it rather than answering it.
A launch under `config/claude-permission-mode=auto` never meets the bypass confirmation, because it does not request bypass mode: on 2.1.269 `claude --permission-mode auto` reached the composer directly with the footer `⏵⏵ auto mode on (shift+tab to cycle)`, so a captain who refuses the bypass dialog selects `auto` there instead of accepting it.
The workspace-trust dialog is unaffected by the permission mode and still needs the pre-registration above.

## Commit and PR attribution

Claude states its own commit and PR attribution inside the Bash tool description it ships in the system prompt ("End git commit messages with: `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...`" plus a `Claude-Session:` URL).
That is a harness instruction, not a model preference, so a brief, a project `AGENTS.md`, or the captain's global memory can only argue with it, and a lost argument is how the agent co-author trailer `AGENTS.md` section 1 forbids reaches a project's default branch.
The spawn therefore launches every claude worker with `--settings '{"attribution":{"commit":"","pr":"","sessionUrl":false}}'`, which removes the instruction rather than contradicting it; `--settings` loads ADDITIONAL settings, so it composes with the per-worktree `.claude/settings.local.json` carrying the busy-state hooks.
`tests/fm-claude-attribution.test.sh` pins the launch and `tests/fm-claude-attribution-live-e2e.test.sh` is the live guard for the settings key itself, with dated evidence in `docs/verification/runtime-backends.md`.

## Composer ghost

Completed turns can render dim predicted text inside an empty composer, indistinguishable in plain `tmux capture-pane`.
The spawn scopes `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_PROMPT_SUGGESTION=false` to every Claude worker and secondmate without changing global config.
CLI `--prompt-suggestions` affects print or SDK mode only and did not suppress interactive ghost text on v2.1.186.

As defense in depth, `fm_composer_strip_ghost` in `../../../bin/fm-composer-lib.sh` removes SGR-2 runs before pending classification on styled tmux, Herdr, and Zellij readers.
`../../../docs/herdr-backend.md` under "Composer and injection safety" owns dark-TRUECOLOR tradeoffs and `../../../docs/verification/runtime-backends.md` owns captures.
Styled capture stays internal to the boolean detector; `fm-peek` and model-facing captures remain plain, without escapes.

## Feedback drafts

The spawn disables Claude's `/bug` and `/feedback` model-drafted feedback flow for every Claude worker and secondmate, preventing a fleet-launched agent from queuing or submitting a bug report on the captain's behalf.
The controls are scoped to the launched process and never modify the captain's global Claude settings; `launch_template()` in `../../../../../bin/fm-spawn.sh` owns their exact mechanics and defense-in-depth rationale.

## Primary integration

Primary behavior was verified 2026-07-04 on 2.1.201, preserved 2026-07-08 on 2.1.204, and Stop auto-arm revalidated 2026-07-24 on 2.1.219.
This differs from the worker hook, which only touches a task marker through `.claude/settings.local.json`.

Primary `.claude/settings.json` registers `../../../bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh --claude` and `../../../bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh` with `asyncRewake: true` and `timeout: 28800`.
Guard exit 2 plus stderr forces continuation.
Stop payload `stop_hook_active=true` follows any hook-driven continuation, including async reawakening, so Claude mode ignores it and uses cooperative claim and epoch plus bounded re-block; default Codex mode keeps it as a one-block loop guard.

Project `.claude/settings.json` loads only when the exact project root is the session root; Claude does not search parents, so Firstmate starts at repository root.
Hooks still run through cwd-sensitive `/bin/sh`, so tracked commands anchor through `"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"/bin/...`.
`../../../docs/turnend-guard.md` owns details.

The Stop-owned watcher hook runs every Stop, foregrounds `../../../bin/fm-watch-arm.sh` only when eligible, and uses exit-2 async reawakening as notification.
The model handles notifications but never routine re-arm.
Claude's PreToolUse seatbelt blocks directly, and its deny is honored only with empty stdout; `../../../docs/arm-pretool-check.md` owns that contract.

### Delegation guard

Claude delegation, scheduling, and worktree tools can create work without `state/<id>.meta`, making guards unable to count it.
`../../../bin/fm-subagent-pretool-check.sh` denies delegation-shaped tool names.
A primary should also keep an untracked home-local `permissions.deny` for known delegation tools so they disappear from the schema.
Never track it in project `.claude/settings.json`, which is Claude-only and propagates to worker copies where it would disarm legitimate delegation.
`../../../docs/subagent-guard.md` owns the contract, recommendation, `FM_ALLOW_SUBAGENT=1`, and applicability review.

On Claude 2.1.217 the tool presents as `Agent`, and both `Agent` and `Task` worked as deny keys in an A/B with nonsense control.
`permissions.allow` pre-approves rather than controls availability, so no closed positive allowlist exists.
