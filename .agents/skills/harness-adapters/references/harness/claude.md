# Claude

Busy hooks verified 2026-07-28 on Claude Code 2.1.220.

## Operating facts

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Busy | Owned hooks: `UserPromptSubmit` opens while `Stop`, `StopFailure`, and `SessionEnd` close; manual interrupt emits no hook, so control reports delivered keys and live endpoint only, publishes no idle event or cancellation claim, and usually leaves `claude-hook` busy. |
| Exit | `/exit`. |
| Interrupt | Single Escape. |
| Skill | `/<skill>`, for example `/no-mistakes`. |
| Model | `--model <model>`; discover through the interactive `/model` picker, with alias or full-name shape documented by `claude --help`. |
| Effort | `--effort <low\|medium\|high\|xhigh\|max>`, verified on 2.1.196. |

## Workspace trust

Claude gates a folder it has never seen behind an interactive workspace-trust dialog, so every fresh task worktree would hit it.
`--dangerously-skip-permissions` does not cover that gate: `claude --help` records that the dialog is skipped only in non-interactive mode, through `-p` or a non-TTY stdout, and a crewmate pane is interactive.
A ship or scout spawn therefore pre-registers the worktree before launch, and the dialog does not appear.
`../../../bin/fm-claude-trust.sh` records `hasTrustDialogAccepted` for that worktree path in `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME}/.claude.json`, and `../../../bin/fm-spawn.sh` refuses the spawn when the write fails rather than launching a worker that would wedge.

Never try to answer the trust dialog with a key.
Firstmate's key plane carries only Enter, Escape, and C-c with no arrow navigation, so it cannot move a dialog's selection at all, and the observed rendering starts on `No, exit`, which means a sent Enter ends the session instead of accepting.
A visible trust dialog means pre-registration did not take effect, so inspect the store and the spawn's error output rather than sending keys.

The once-per-machine bypass-permissions confirmation is a separate dialog, scoped to the machine rather than the path, and pre-registration does not address it.
Never send Enter to that one either: it was observed rendering in the same shape as the trust dialog, with the selection on `No, exit` and the footer `Enter to confirm . Esc to cancel`, so Enter ends the session rather than accepting.
Firstmate cannot move a selection with Enter, Escape, and C-c alone, so it cannot accept this dialog at all, and an operator accepts it once per machine instead.
Inspect the pane to identify which dialog is on screen, and report it rather than answering it.

## Commit and PR attribution

Claude states its own commit and PR attribution inside the Bash tool description it ships in the system prompt ("End git commit messages with: `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...`" plus a `Claude-Session:` URL).
That is a harness instruction, not a model preference, so a brief, a project `AGENTS.md`, or the captain's global memory can only argue with it, and a lost argument is how the agent co-author trailer `AGENTS.md` section 1 forbids reaches a project's default branch.
The spawn therefore launches every claude worker with `--settings '{"attribution":{"commit":"","pr":"","sessionUrl":false}}'`, which removes the instruction rather than contradicting it; `--settings` loads ADDITIONAL settings, so it composes with the per-worktree `.claude/settings.local.json` carrying the busy-state hooks.
`tests/fm-claude-attribution.test.sh` pins the launch and `tests/fm-claude-attribution-live-e2e.test.sh` is the live guard for the settings key itself, with dated evidence in `docs/verification/runtime-backends.md`.

## Composer ghost

Completed turns can render dim predicted text inside an empty composer, indistinguishable in plain `tmux capture-pane`.
The spawn scopes `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_PROMPT_SUGGESTION=false` to every Claude worker and secondmate without changing global config.
CLI `--prompt-suggestions` affects print or SDK mode only and did not suppress interactive ghost text on v2.1.186.

As defense in depth, `fm_composer_strip_ghost` in `../../../bin/fm-composer-lib.sh` removes SGR-2 runs before pending classification on styled tmux, Herdr, and Zellij readers.
`../../../docs/herdr-backend.md` under "Composer and injection safety" owns dark-TRUECOLOR tradeoffs and `../../../docs/verification/runtime-backends.md` owns captures.
Styled capture stays internal to the boolean detector; `fm-peek` and model-facing captures remain plain, without escapes.

## Feedback drafts

The spawn disables Claude's `/bug` and `/feedback` model-drafted feedback flow for every Claude worker and secondmate, preventing a fleet-launched agent from queuing or submitting a bug report on the captain's behalf.
The controls are scoped to the launched process and never modify the captain's global Claude settings; `launch_template()` in `../../../../../bin/fm-spawn.sh` owns their exact mechanics and defense-in-depth rationale.

## Primary integration

Primary behavior was verified 2026-07-04 on 2.1.201, preserved 2026-07-08 on 2.1.204, and Stop auto-arm revalidated 2026-07-24 on 2.1.219.
This differs from the worker hook, which only touches a task marker through `.claude/settings.local.json`.

Primary `.claude/settings.json` registers `../../../bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh --claude` and `../../../bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh` with `asyncRewake: true` and `timeout: 28800`.
Guard exit 2 plus stderr forces continuation.
Stop payload `stop_hook_active=true` follows any hook-driven continuation, including async reawakening, so Claude mode ignores it and uses cooperative claim and epoch plus bounded re-block; default Codex mode keeps it as a one-block loop guard.

Project `.claude/settings.json` loads only when the exact project root is the session root; Claude does not search parents, so Firstmate starts at repository root.
Hooks still run through cwd-sensitive `/bin/sh`, so tracked commands anchor through `"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"/bin/...`.
`../../../docs/turnend-guard.md` owns details.

The Stop-owned watcher hook runs every Stop, foregrounds `../../../bin/fm-watch-arm.sh` only when eligible, and uses exit-2 async reawakening as notification.
The model handles notifications but never routine re-arm.
Claude's PreToolUse seatbelt blocks directly, and its deny is honored only with empty stdout; `../../../docs/arm-pretool-check.md` owns that contract.

### Delegation guard

Claude delegation, scheduling, and worktree tools can create work without `state/<id>.meta`, making guards unable to count it.
`../../../bin/fm-subagent-pretool-check.sh` denies delegation-shaped tool names.
A primary should also keep an untracked home-local `permissions.deny` for known delegation tools so they disappear from the schema.
Never track it in project `.claude/settings.json`, which is Claude-only and propagates to worker copies where it would disarm legitimate delegation.
`../../../docs/subagent-guard.md` owns the contract, recommendation, `FM_ALLOW_SUBAGENT=1`, and applicability review.

On Claude 2.1.217 the tool presents as `Agent`, and both `Agent` and `Task` worked as deny keys in an A/B with nonsense control.
`permissions.allow` pre-approves rather than controls availability, so no closed positive allowlist exists.
