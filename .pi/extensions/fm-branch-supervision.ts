// Firstmate supervision branch for Pi (docs/pi-supervision-branch.md).
//
// A second AgentSession - the supervision BRANCH - inside the same pi process
// as the captain's MAIN session, living for exactly one main session: every
// main session start (cold start, /new, /resume, /fork, reload) opens a NEW
// branch conversation, so the branch reasons from today's generated prompt and
// the current main dialog instead of an older thread's accumulated memory. The
// durable outcome store, not that conversation, is what carries unacknowledged
// captain-facing outcomes across the boundary. The watcher extension offers each
// actionable wake here (lib/fm-branch-dispatch.ts); the branch handles it with
// real tools and reports through the fm_branch_report custom tool, which
// writes the durable outcome store FIRST (bin/fm-branch-outcome.sh), then
// persists a sequence-keyed visible record in main's transcript, and for a
// captain-facing outcome opens one sequence-keyed processing turn on main
// that stays open until main acknowledges that sequence (see
// presentUnprocessedOutcomes).
// Main's captain/assistant dialog is mirrored into the branch as read-only
// fm-main-mirror context from Pi's
// before_agent_start prompt and at main's turn_end. Pi-only by construction: this
// file lives in .pi/extensions, so no
// other harness ever loads it. Supervision is default-on for every task once
// this Pi session owns the fleet lock: no captain grant file is required.
// Away mode (or a broken branch between its bounded recovery probes) keeps
// today's wake-to-main behavior untouched regardless.
//
// Prefix stability (the cache contract, owner: bin/fm-branch-prompt.sh
// header): the branch's system prompt is the generator's byte-stable output,
// the tool set is BRANCH_TOOL_NAMES in that fixed order on every spawn, and
// one shared per-home prompt_cache_key is set for branch requests in a
// before_provider_request hook - main keeps Pi's default per-session key.
// Wakes, mirrored dialog, and merge notes are all appends at a tail.
//
// Session-lock ownership: every branch side-effect boundary re-evaluates the
// current extension generation and lock ownership LAZILY, the same way the
// watcher extension evaluates ownership at arm time. A cold
// Pi start acquires the lock only when the session runs fm-session-start.sh,
// so latching ownership once at session_start would leave the branch inert
// for the whole process; and a secondary read-only Pi session that never owns
// the lock must never write markers, clean leases, or accept wakes.
//
// Failure direction: every accepted path that cannot reach a working branch
// rejects its settlement to the watcher, which retains delivery ownership and
// routes the wake to MAIN through its consumption-acknowledged path. A broken
// branch declines later offers, so they take that same watcher path directly.
// The wake queue itself stays durable until the handler runs the drain's
// acknowledgement, so a branch that dies mid-handling re-presents its rows at
// the next drain exactly as a mid-handling main crash always has.
//
// Model and effort selection: supervision is an easier job than main, so the
// captain can pin a cheaper model AND a shallower reasoning effort for the
// branch alone with /supervision-model, which picks from Pi's own catalog and
// Pi's own supported-thinking-level list and persists each choice as one line
// under this home's config/. docs/configuration.md owns those files'
// operator-facing schema. The two pins are independent: either, both, or
// neither may be set. An absent pin makes the branch follow main's own
// current model or effort, applied explicitly on every build so a reopened
// branch cannot restore what an earlier pin left in its session.
//
// Threat model (captain-decided): the branch's actor identity is
// CONFUSED-AGENT-GRADE - deterministic spawnHook env injection plus a
// readonly-variable shell prelude so an accidental override fails loudly
// inside the branch's own shell. bin/fm-lease-lib.sh documents the grade and
// its deliberate limits.
