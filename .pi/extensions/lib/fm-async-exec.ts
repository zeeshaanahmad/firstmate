// Pi runs extensions, their tools, and their event handlers on the single
// JavaScript thread that also draws the TUI and reads the keyboard, and it
// starts no worker for them. A spawnSync call from an extension therefore
// stops repaint and key echo for the child's whole lifetime, which a
// supervision outcome made visible as a subsecond freeze every time one
// arrived (docs/pi-supervision-branch.md "Off-thread delivery").
//
// This is the one owner of that replacement: the status, UTF-8 stdout, and
// UTF-8 stderr fields these callers consumed from spawnSync, produced by an
// awaited spawn so the event loop keeps running while the child does. Callers
// keep their own ordering guarantees - awaiting here
// yields the thread, so anything that must not interleave belongs behind a
// serializing queue in the caller.
//
// Like spawnSync, a spawn that never starts and a child killed by a signal
// both report a null status rather than throwing, so a caller's existing
// "status !== 0" failure branch keeps its meaning unchanged.
