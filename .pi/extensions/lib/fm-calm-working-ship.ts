// Firstmate's Calm-only animated working presentation.
//
// Calm replaces Pi's stock working row with a tiny SSHHIP-derived boat while one
// logical agent run is active. This module owns only the sprite geometry, the bounce
// track, the two animation cadences, the session-scoped freeze/resume state, and the
// temporary TUI widget; `.pi/extensions/fm-calm.ts` owns when the presentation is
// installed and removed, and stays the sole caller of setWorkingVisible().
// docs/calm.md owns the captain-facing contract.
//
// Cadence: one scheduler drives two linked cadences. Every tick advances the wave by
// one quarter-cell, and every CALM_WORKING_SHIP_TICKS_PER_MOVE-th tick moves the boat
// one whole cell, so the trough stays phase-locked to a deliberately calm boat.
// Both cadences stop together when the widget is disposed.
// Ticks, not wall-clock timestamps, drive every state change, so tests can seek time exactly.
//
// Continuity: one extension-owned animation instance survives hide/show within the same
// Pi process and Calm extension lifetime. Disposing the widget freezes column,
// direction, water phase, and tick cadence without advancing them for hidden wall
// time. The next working period resumes from that exact logical state. A fresh session
// or new extension lifetime calls reset() and starts at the normal initial position.
// State is never a module-level or process-global singleton.
//
// Verified against Pi 0.81.1 declarations and the Pi 0.82.0 CLI, which expose
// ExtensionUIContext.setWidget() with a component factory, per-widget dispose(), and
// TUI.requestRender(). Pi renders a widget through Component.render(width), so this
// module recomputes its track from that width on every frame instead of caching a
// terminal size that a resize would invalidate. A resize while the boat is hidden is
// applied on the first resumed frame through the same clamp path.
