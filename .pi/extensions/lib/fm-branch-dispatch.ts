// SYNCHRONOUSLY inside its handler (the event bus invokes handlers
// synchronously up to their first await), so after emit returns the watcher
// reads `accepted`: true means the branch owns handling the wake, and its
// settlement promise keeps the watcher outcome pending until handling finishes

// means no branch took it and the watcher delivers to main exactly as it did
// before the branch existed. Watcher-failure alarms are never offered - only
// main can repair the watcher cycle (fm_watch_arm_pi lives on main).

// failures, and every other legitimately main-only class - never vetoes a scan
// in either mode. It is simply excluded from eligibleSeqs and left queued for

// row happened to be sitting unread, which put a routine fleet review in the

// guarantees: a heartbeat review takes EVERY branch-ownable unread row or none
// of them. An unresolvable signal/stale row (unmapped project) still vetoes the
// whole scan in both modes, because that is a data/metadata problem this
// function cannot safely reason past, not an ordinary main-only event. A row
// this repo's fm_wake_append could never have produced (an unknown kind, or a
