# tests/fm-backlog-read-bound.test.sh - behavior tests for the per-item bound on
# bin/fm-backlog-transition-lib.sh's backlog row read.
#
# The defect this pins: bin/fm-bootstrap.sh's reconcile and close-replay sweeps
# read the backlog backend once per item, and an unbounded read of a wedged
# backend consumed the whole FM_SESSION_START_TIMEOUT. The digest was then
# truncated before the wake queue, supervision instructions, fleet state, and
# context sections printed, leaving a whole fleet unsupervised.
#
# Both halves are proved here:
#   - a deliberately hanging `tasks-axi show` cannot exceed the per-item bound,
#     and the failure names the item it could not read
#   - a session start against that same wedged backend still completes end to
#     end, with every digest section present and a loud partial reconcile
#
# The bound must hold on its own, independent of any particular tasks-axi
# install, so the fake here simply never returns.
