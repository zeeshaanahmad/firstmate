# Contract tests for .github/workflows/ci.yml's runner-spend safeguards.
#
# Origin: the 2026-09-12 GitHub Actions starvation incident. firstmate CI had no
# concurrency deduplication, so every superseded PR head kept its full job
# fan-out, and four jobs carried no timeout at all. These tests hold both
# safeguards: PR runs supersede within one PR while main pushes are never
# cancelled, and every CI job carries a finite hang tripwire.
#
# The workflow is parsed as YAML and its concurrency expressions are resolved
# against simulated pull_request and push contexts, so the assertions describe
# what GitHub would do, not how the file happens to be spelled.
