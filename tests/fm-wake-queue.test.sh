# interval alone. The backdated meta stands in for that long-running mate. The
# busy exemption is instead bounded by how long the queue itself has been frozen,
# so a mate stuck busy forever still alarms.
#
# Scope, so this case is not read as more coverage than it is: the fixture arms
# the busy contract by hand through fm-busy-event.sh. A real --secondmate spawn
# never does - bin/fm-spawn.sh arms the contract inside its `[ "$KIND" !=
# secondmate ]` guard, so both arm calls are skipped for a mate - and with no
# record fm_busy_classify_meta answers "unknown missing" for a tmux-backed
# claude, pi, opencode, or omp mate, which is not a busy verdict. Hand-arming is
# what isolates the launch-aging defect this case pins, and the launch-aging
# defect is all it pins: on tmux the stall alarm is still reachable through that

# sweep uses), every relaunch emits exactly one `check` wake plus a durable
