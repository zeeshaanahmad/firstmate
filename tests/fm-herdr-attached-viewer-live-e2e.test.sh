# Live attached-viewer regression for the Herdr teardown focus guard.
#
# PR #4131 gated the active-tab close refusal on a LIVE foreground client
# instead of the persisted `.focused` pointer, but only its two detached
# scenarios could be driven live: every pseudo-terminal the runner built
# started at a zero-sized window grid, so Herdr registered no foreground client
# and `terminal title clear` kept answering `no_foreground_client`. That was a
# harness limit, not a product one. `fm-herdr-lab.sh viewer start` now attaches
# a real Herdr TUI over a pty sized before the fork, which turns those
# untestable cases into this regression:
#
#   3. a viewer sitting on the target tab blocks the close;
#   4. a viewer that moves ONTO the target between planning and the mutation
#      boundary still blocks it, because the guard re-reads focus there;
#   5. a viewer that moves OFF the target instead keeps its fresh non-target
#      focus after the close, rather than being dragged back to a stale
#      pre-planning pointer;
#   7. the projection's seeded-tab prune inherits the same refusal.
#
# Scenarios 4 and 5 need a focus change at one exact product boundary, so a
# PATH shim performs the real `tab focus` when the close helper issues its
# planning `pane get`. Every Herdr call, the shim's included, still routes
# through the guarded lab helper against a named non-default session.
#
# The guard submits no model prompts, so the shared live gate runs it wherever
# herdr, jq, and python3 exist. Re-run it after every Herdr upgrade: a release
# that changed the foreground-client contract would surface here first.
