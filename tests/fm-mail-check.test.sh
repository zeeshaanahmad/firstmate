# Behavior tests for bin/fm-mail-check.sh, the standing received-mail check.
#
# Two surfaces are exercised through their executable interfaces:
#
#   * arming/disarming state/mail.check.sh with its trust binding, including
#     the refusal paths (symlink at the shim path, missing mail plane);
#
#   * the `check` action itself, which runs the real fm-mail.sh poll against a
#     scratch home whose .env and fake python3 decide the outcome. The cases
#     that matter are the reporting contract: a successful poll that surfaces
#     new mail emits one wake line (the poll still also surfaces new mail as
#     durable wakes), a failing poll reports one line, a proven no-op stays
#     silent, and fail-closed-after-queue or timeout still doorbells.
#
# No case ever contacts a real IMAP or SMTP server.
