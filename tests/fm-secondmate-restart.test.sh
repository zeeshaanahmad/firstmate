# bin/fm-secondmate-restart.sh: persist-then-restart, and the honest fallback.
#
# What these pin, all through the real commands (real fm-send, real durable
# steering inbox, real parent-owned reply expectation, real fm-control
# transaction) against a lifecycle-modelling session-provider stub:
#
#   1. The persist request is a GATE. Nothing is stopped until that mate's own
#      correlated answer lands on the parent channel, and a mate that never
#      answers keeps its agent and gets the re-read message instead.
#   2. The order is persist THEN restart, observable in what reaches the pane.
#   3. The persist request is the task-subset of /stow: it asks for open records
#      and task status, and explicitly not for the memory, learnings, or
#      captain-preference sweeps.
#   4. Every unsafe case says what is known: pre-restart capability and persist
#      failures use the nudge path, while a failed relaunch is reported as an
#      unknown outcome; none is reported as a clean reload.
#   5. A remote mate restarts by running the SAME local control-plane relaunch on
#      its host, over the fm-on transport, with the profile resolved from the
#      PARENT's own pin rather than the remote home's copy of it.
#   6. End to end with bin/fm-update.sh: a live mate whose home needed no
#      fast-forward is still named for restart and genuinely restarted, and one
#      whose runtime cannot prove a restart keeps the honest re-read path with
#      its agent left running.
