# capture-reservation cleanup first, and that cleanup re-verifies the recorded
# state-root identity. Once that identity stopped matching, a claim naming a pid
# and a process group that were both provably gone could not be cleared:
# reconcile kept reporting a start while nothing ever attached, and retire
# refused with "cannot release source ownership". Reservation records are keyed
# by claim token and a replacement always claims a fresh one, so they can never
# collide with the generation that replaces them - they are hygiene, not an
# ownership invariant, and they must not veto an ownership move that the
# documented promise already grants.
#
# The claim below is the modern shape (it carries the state-root identity block
# a legacy claim does not have), which is why the existing dead-generation case
# above never reached this path.

# reconcile launches the fast source first, then blocks acquiring the held
# lock of the second source, and the holder is released only once the fast
# runner has captured its result and let go of both its claim and its runner
# record. Confirmation therefore starts strictly after the fast runner is gone.

# were broken, in ways that hid each other:
#
#   - The stop held the per-source lock across its wait while the runner's own
#     exit cleanup waited for that same lock, so the runner outlived the ordinary
#     signal every time and the forced kill silently became the normal path.
#   - The escalation re-derived ownership from the leader, so once the leader did
#     die to the stop's own signal it read that success as a leaderless group and
#     refused to escalate at all.
#
# With only the first repaired, the second turned every stop of a signal-proof
# child into a refusal that left it running. They are asserted together because
# they only hold together.
#
# Earlier fixtures include TERM-resistant children and deliberately kept-alive
# leaders. The cases below also exercise escalation after TERM ends the leader.

#
# The bound: the lease term, plus ONE check interval. The guard still refuses to
# act on a single failed read - the debounce case below is what defends that -
# but its two confirming reads are spaced half an interval apart, so the pair
# fits inside the one interval budgeted here. A guard that put a whole interval
# between them would spend two, and this deadline is sized to catch exactly that.
#
# THE PHASE IS OBSERVED AND ENFORCED, NOT ASSUMED. Where the lease expiry falls
# relative to the guard's own check clock decides whether a run lands near the
# bound or well inside it, and a sampled phase would let a guard spending two
# intervals slip under this deadline on a lucky alignment. So the lease is
# synchronized to the guard's own FIRST observed lease read, every later real
# read is recorded, and the case then REFUSES unless one of those reads proves
# the required phase: fresh, before expiry, and late enough that two further
# full intervals could not finish before the deadline.
#
# Pinning the phase by construction instead - from an assumed startup time - is
# what an earlier version of this case did, and it is not enough: the day
# startup reaches two seconds it silently stops rejecting a two-interval guard
