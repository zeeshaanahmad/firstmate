# tests/fm-bearings-board-lavish-live-e2e.test.sh - live drift guard proving
# the real lavish-axi still behaves the way bin/fm-bearings-board.sh's session
# liveness check is written against.
#
# Why this file exists: the build's "is this board actually live" verdict comes
# from what lavish-axi emits, which is a surface the vendor controls and changes
# without notice. The defect this guards was exactly that - opening a session
# the captain had ended from the browser EXITS 0 while refusing to reopen, so a
# build that trusted the exit status armed a poll against a dead session and the
# board read "not listening" with nobody watching it. A stubbed lavish-axi can
# only confirm the assumption already written into the stub, so the assumption
# itself needs a run against the real tool.
#
# The captain-ended state is reached through the same server route the browser's
# End session button calls, so no browser is needed and nothing here depends on
# a human. The artifact is a scratch page in a temporary directory, and the
# session it opens is ended again before the guard returns.
#
# Standard CI has no lavish-axi, so this reports a capability skip there. The
# portable counterpart in tests/fm-bearings-board.test.sh pins the build's logic
# in CI against a stub that reproduces these shapes. Run this guard after a
# lavish-axi upgrade and before trusting refreshed evidence.
