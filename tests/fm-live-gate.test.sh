# Behavior tests for tests/lib.sh's fm_live_gate, the single decision every
# live-harness guard opens with, and for the wiring that makes that decision
# reach the whole family.
#
# The gate is what turns "a live guard exists" into "a live guard actually ran
# on the machine that has the harness", so the cases below drive it the way a
# guard does: real scripts, executed as separate processes, with a fakebin PATH
# standing in for a host that does or does not have the tool. Nothing here reads
# tests/lib.sh's source text.
#
# The family sweep at the end runs every real live guard with FM_LIVE=0 and
# requires the shared refusal line, which is the only way to prove each guard is
# wired to the shared gate rather than to a private env check of its own. It is
# cheap because a disabled gate exits before a guard touches a harness.
