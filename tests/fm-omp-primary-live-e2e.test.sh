# Opt-in credentialed omp (Oh My Pi) primary regression in an isolated lab
# checkout. It drives a real omp through its JSON-RPC stdio mode so no terminal
# multiplexer is needed, uses the captain's existing omp login without copying
# any credential, and defaults to the captain-approved openai-codex model.
#
# It proves, against the installed omp, everything the portable suite
# (tests/fm-omp-harness.test.sh) can only pin over a fake API:
#   1. both tracked .omp/extensions load by auto-discovery alone;
#   2. the session-start digest reaches model context before the first turn
#      and the session lock names the omp process (ancestry detection);
#   3. fm_watch_arm_omp starts a real watcher, an actionable close spawns a
#      ledger-linked successor, and the wake arrives as one follow-up turn;
#   4. with the successor watcher frozen until its beacon passes the lab grace,
#      the next turn end is genuinely unsupervised, so session_stop must compel
#      the turn-end guard continuation and the model reaches for the tool.
