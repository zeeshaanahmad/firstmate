# Default-on live guard for the Herdr stale-registration classifier (issue
# #4115) against the REAL Pi harness under the REAL Herdr binary.
#
# The defect: Herdr keeps a Pi registration (`agent get` -> agent=pi,
# agent_status=idle) after the Pi process has exited to a plain shell whenever
# a nested interactive shell sits under the pane's top shell - the crew shape,
# where `treehouse get` leaves a worktree shell under the pane's login shell.
# The adapter now proves an agent at process level before trusting a
# registration, and this guard measures the two vendor facts that proof rests
# on, which no fixture can prove:
#
#   1. how Pi presents in `pane process-info` (on Herdr 0.9.0 the kernel name
#      is `node` and only argv0 says `pi`), so the shared process classifier
#      must still attribute the running harness as `agent`;
#   2. whether this Herdr release still leaves the registration behind after
#      Pi quits under a nested shell, so the stale-registration branch is
#      exercised against the real record rather than a canned one.
#
# It fails naming the Herdr and Pi versions when either fact drifts. Pi is
# launched with no prompt and quit immediately, so no model token is spent and
# the shared live gate runs it by default wherever both tools are installed.
# Run it after every Herdr or Pi upgrade and before trusting a refreshed
# docs/verification/runtime-backends.md "Stale agent registration" entry.
#
# Always runs on a private, named, throwaway lab session, never the default
# one (tests/herdr-test-safety.sh; bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh owns the isolation).
