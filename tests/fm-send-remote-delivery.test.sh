# fm-send remote-secondmate delivery reporting.
#
# The remote send leg (fm-on.sh -> fm-remote-secondmate-control.sh cmd_send)
# runs fm-send's own verified submit host-locally on the remote machine and
# relays its exit status unchanged. A leg that delivered the text into the
# live verified pane but could not synchronously confirm the submit exits 3
# (the delivered-unconfirmed contract in bin/fm-send.sh's header); flattening
# that into a generic failure produced the false "error: text not sent"
# report that tempted duplicate resends of steers that had actually landed.
# These tests pin the delivery-reporting contract over the real fm-send +
# fm-on executables with a stubbed ssh transport (FM_SSH_BIN seam - the same
# process boundary tests/fm-on.test.sh proves preserves exit status):
#   1. Remote delivered-unconfirmed (ssh exit 3) is NOT a failure: exit 0, a
#      non-error delivered notice, the inner leg's stderr held back, and the
#      pending-reply expectation marked delivered (awaiting_report).
#   2. A real remote failure (nonzero, not 3/255) still fails loudly with the
#      remote stderr replayed and the undelivered expectation discarded.
#   3. Transport-unknown (ssh exit 255) still refuses loudly and preserves the
#      expectation as delivery_unknown.
#   4. A delivered-unconfirmed remote answer still closes its --resolve-key
#      decision (delivered-with-pending-confirmation counts as delivered).
#   5. A LOCAL send whose submit read-back stays pending exits 3 with an
#      honest non-error message (text delivered, submission unconfirmed).
#   6. That local unconfirmed send still never closes a --resolve-key
#      decision (the local ledger boundary is unchanged).
