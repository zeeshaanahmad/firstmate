# fm-send pre-submit popup-settle selection (the codex `$<skill>` fix).
#
# Some TUIs open a completion popup when the composer's first character triggers
# it: codex (and others) for a leading `/` slash command, and codex specifically
# for a leading `$<skill>` invocation (e.g. `$no-mistakes`). Submitting before the
# popup settles lets it swallow the Enter, so the line never submits. fm-send
# absorbs this by pausing `settle` seconds AFTER typing and BEFORE the (retried)
# Enter - the first sleep fm_tmux_submit_core makes. These tests pin the
# settle-SELECTION matrix hermetically (stubbed tmux + sleep, no real agent):
#
#   /...            -> 1.2  (universal; `/` only starts a command, never plain text)
#   $... to codex   -> 1.2  (scoped: codex opens a `$<skill>` popup)
#   $... to claude  -> 0.3  (NOT codex: `$` commonly starts plain text "$5", "$HOME")
#   $... explicit   -> 0.3  (session:window target has no meta -> harness unknown
#                            -> non-codex safe default)
#   plain text      -> 0.3  (fast path)
#
# The popup-settle is the FIRST sleep recorded: fm_tmux_submit_core types the text,
# then `sleep "$settle"`, then the Enter-retry loop (sleep 0.4 each) and finally
# fm-send's own post-submit FM_SEND_SETTLE pause. So tail-vs-head matters: this
# suite asserts on the HEAD sleep, distinct from fm-send-settle.test.sh which pins
# the TAIL (post-submit) pause. The retried Enter in fm_tmux_submit_core remains the
# real safety net; this settle is only the optimization that lets the popup clear so
# the first Enter lands.
#
# Every case below passes a LITERAL `$<skill>` / `$price` message in single quotes
# on purpose - the whole point is to send an unexpanded `$...` line to the agent -
# so SC2016 (which flags single-quoted `$` as a probably-forgotten expansion) is a
# false positive here and is disabled file-wide.
