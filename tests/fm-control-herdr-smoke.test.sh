# tests/fm-control-herdr-smoke.test.sh - real-herdr smoke test for the agent
# lifecycle control plane (bin/fm-control.sh).
#
# tmux is the control plane's reference backend and is covered hermetically in
# tests/fm-control.test.sh. herdr is the OTHER backend whose recovery-grade
# agent-state classifier the control plane is allowed to trust, so its
# behavior is pinned here against the REAL binary rather than a stub: whether
# an agent is running, and therefore whether a lifecycle verb may act at all,
# comes from herdr's own agent registry.
#
# No real harness is launched. herdr's `pane report-agent` is the same registry
# the adapter reads, and a symlink named like a harness is the same process
# identity the adapter proves through `pane process-info`, so registering an
# agent over a real agent-named process, over a plain shell, and not at all
# exercises exactly the classification the control plane gates on - including
# the registration Herdr keeps after the agent process is gone (issue #4115).
#
# Always runs on a private, named, throwaway lab session, never the default
# one (tests/herdr-test-safety.sh; the 2026-07-02 incident). Skips cleanly
# when herdr or jq is missing.
