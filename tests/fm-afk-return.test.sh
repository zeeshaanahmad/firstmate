# Deterministic return-catch-up gate and return-brief regression.
#
# Covers the second half of the 2026-07-14 incident: an away-mode blocked event
# survived in durable state, but the ordinary return request could proceed to
# Bearings before Firstmate owned remediation. The shared script now stops,
# drains, preserves evidence, and holds ordinary WORK until every live open
# `blocked:` event is resolved or durably reclassified. Reporting is not work:
# Bearings renders behind the catch-up gate and surfaces the catch-up posture
# as content, so a returning captain still gets the picture.
# The brief cases pin the away-posture redesign's return: the brief is composed
# from the archived posture record, the outcome store, the held set, and the
# status logs, health first, and the gate shrinks to what the away session could
# not fix.
