# Behavior tests for bin/fm-harness.sh's marker-vs-ancestry precedence boundary,
# and for the supervision protocol session start selects from it.
#
# The bug this pins: a Codex session started from an environment that had
# retained CLAUDECODE=1 detected as claude, because a verified marker outranked
# ancestry unconditionally. Session start then emitted Claude's Stop-owned
# supervision protocol to a Codex primary, which blocked every turn end.
#
# Every case drives the two evidence layers APART deliberately and asserts each
# one alone as well as the combination, so no case can pass vacuously if a layer
# silently stops working:
#   marker alone   - ancestry blinded by a fake ps, proving the marker is live
#                    and is what the old precedence would have returned.
#   ancestry alone - marker cleared, proving the ancestry signal is live.
#   both together  - the precedence verdict this file exists to pin.
# The fake ps blinds only the ancestry walk, and the suite proves that rather
# than assuming it. fm-harness.sh reads process ancestry through ps alone; the
# one source it does not read through ps is the Cursor argv[0] probe, which on
# Linux reads /proc directly and on macOS falls back to ps. Either way it
# resolves the harmless real path of a bash-named process, which
# fm_cursor_process_matches rejects. The no-marker case below asserts `unknown`
# under the fake ps on whichever platform the run happens on, and it is exactly
# that case that fails if the blinding ever leaks a real ancestor through.
