# Opt-in live guard for the Claude, Codex exec, and Pi RUN-tier session-open adapters.
# Cursor's source-free RUN-tier transport is covered with its stop-hook park by
# tests/fm-cursor-primary-live-e2e.test.sh.
#
# Three facts in this area come from the vendor, not from Firstmate, so a stub
# can only confirm the assumption already written into the stub:
#
#   (a) the harness tells the hook WHICH session open this is, well enough that
#       a context-preserving reopen is never mistaken for a context reset,
#   (b) hook stdout actually reaches model context on a context-RESET open
#       (clear/compact), not only on a cold startup, and
#   (c) a worker the hook detaches SURVIVES the hook returning. Session start
#       moved every external-network call into such a worker
#       (bin/fm-startup-network.sh), so a harness that reaps the hook's process
#       tree would silently stop running the sweeps entirely. Whether it does is
#       a vendor behavior no portable test can see.
#
# docs/sessionstart-nudge.md owns the routing facts (a) and (b) feed, and
# tests/fm-sessionstart-nudge.test.sh pins that routing portably with real
# processes and no harness. This guard covers only what CI cannot see.
#
# It swaps a RECORDER in for bin/fm-sessionstart-run.sh inside a throwaway lab
# checkout, so nothing here touches a real home, lock, or fleet. The recorder
# logs the source the harness supplied and prints a source-stamped token; the
# model is then asked to quote that token back, which is the only way to prove
# the stdout genuinely landed in context rather than merely being produced.
# The token index advances on every open, so a stale earlier token can never
# satisfy a later assertion and no case can go quietly vacuous.
#
# Run it after every harness upgrade and before trusting refreshed evidence in
# docs/verification/supervision.md:
#
#   FM_SESSIONSTART_HOOK_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-sessionstart-hook-live-e2e.test.sh
#
# It costs real model turns on every installed adapter in this suite.
