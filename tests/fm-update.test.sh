# Tests for bin/fm-update.sh: fast-forward-only self-update of a running
# firstmate repo and every registered secondmate home.
#
# The guarantees under test mirror fm-fleet-sync.sh and prime directive #3:
#   - The running firstmate repo (on its default branch) fast-forwards from
#     origin; a leased secondmate home (detached HEAD on the default branch)
#     fast-forwards the same way.
#   - FAST-FORWARD ONLY: a dirty, diverged, offline, or wrong-branch target is
#     skipped and reported, never forced or stashed, so unlanded work survives.
#   - The update is a single-parent fast-forward (never a merge commit) and a
#     fast-forward of one worktree never disturbs another worktree's checkout
#     or the shared default branch.
#   - The caller-action summary is correct: reread-firstmate flips to yes only
#     when the instruction surface (AGENTS.md / bin / .agents/skills) changed, and
#     the two secondmate action sets are disjoint and correctly gated -
#     restart-secondmates carries EVERY live mate this pass left on origin's tip
#     whose recorded runtime can prove a restart, INCLUDING one that was already
#     there and one whose advance touched no instruction surface, because a
#     restart is also what re-resolves launch-time harness wiring; a live mate
#     whose runtime cannot prove a restart falls to nudge-secondmates; and a mate
#     whose home was skipped or whose endpoint is stopped gets no action at all.
#   - Secondmate homes resolve from both state/<id>.meta and the
#     data/secondmates.md registry, deduped, and the firstmate repo is never
#     re-processed as one of its own secondmates.
