# Drives the real bin/fm-remote-herdr-guard.sh (and the owner library it
# sources) against a fake herdr CLI, a fake lsof that names a real holder
# process as the session-socket owner, and real holder processes whose
# environment and ancestry carry the birth markers the guard reads. It pins
# the decision table: no server -> start; an Aqua-born owner -> leave it; an
# SSH-born or unprovable owner -> stop it, wait for the socket, start. Nothing
# here touches the runner's own herdr servers, launch agents, or login
# session, and no live harness guard applies: the verdict comes from process
# environment and ancestry, which are kernel facts rather than vendor output.
