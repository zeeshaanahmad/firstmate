# fm-send typed-plane submit-confirm budget for agy targets.
#
# A typed send to an explicit tmux agy endpoint is acknowledged only by the
# submit core's idle-to-busy transition poll: agy's bare `>` composer verdict
# is `unknown` (dead-shell rule), so the poll watching the pane's verified
# `esc to cancel` busy footer is the only proof a landed Enter can get. agy
# renders that footer ~1.5s after Enter for a short steer and ~4s for a
# multi-line brief (live-measured on agy 1.2.1), while the shared default
# confirm budget is 3 retries x 0.4s - so fm-send used to exit 1 "not
# submitted" for a message that landed and ran, inviting a duplicate resend.
# fm-send now gives agy typed targets a longer default budget (20 retries,
# ~8s at the default cadence); an explicit FM_SEND_RETRIES still wins and every
# other harness keeps the
# shared 3-retry default. These tests pin that behavior hermetically (stubbed
# tmux + sleep, no real agent): the fake tmux renders the busy footer only
# from the BUSY_AT-th plain pane capture, so the number of logged 0.4s waits
# stands in for wall-clock latency and each case is deterministic:
#   1. agy target, busy footer at the 5th poll (short-steer latency): the send
#      exits 0 (confirmed idle-to-busy), and the sleep log shows the poll
#      reaching that read.
#   2. agy target, busy footer only at the 15th poll (the live-measured long
#      brief latency): the default budget still reaches it and exits 0.
#   3. agy target with an explicit FM_SEND_RETRIES=3: the operator knob wins
#      and the send keeps the loud exit-1 verdict=unknown refusal.
#   4. agy target whose busy footer never renders: no confirmation is
#      fabricated - exit 1 verdict=unknown.
#   5. claude target, same late-busy pane: the shared 3-retry default is
#      untouched, so the send still exits 1 verdict=unknown.
