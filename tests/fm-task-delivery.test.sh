#
# A ship task's delivery mode and yolo posture are firstmate's decision at intake,
# so the tools refuse to guess: the spawn and a scout promotion require both flags,
# validate them against a closed set, and the spawn additionally refuses to launch
# when the brief it is about to hand the worker records a different mode. Scout
# spawns carry no delivery posture at all. The registry keeps only the captain's
# standing posture, for the mechanical consumers and for one advisory notice.
#
# Every spawn case here stops before any endpoint exists: the delivery checks run
# ahead of backend creation, and a fake `tmux` that exits non-zero backstops the
# cases that are meant to get past them, so no window or worktree is ever created.
