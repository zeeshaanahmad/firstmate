# Configuration

The files and environment variables you set to operate firstmate.

## Orchestrator behavior (AGENTS.md)

The shared orchestrator behavior lives in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) - edit it like any prompt when the fleet is empty, or dispatch shared-repo edits to a crewmate while tasks are in flight.

## Operational home layout and state

This section is the single owner of the top-level operational-home layout; producer script headers and their help own exact child-file fields and mutation contracts.
The tracked code root contains the shared instruction, skill, documentation, workflow, and `bin/` surfaces, while each effective `FM_HOME` contains private operational directories.
`data/` holds durable private fleet records such as the project and secondmate registries, captain preferences, optional shared captain preferences, learnings, backlog, briefs, scout reports, and explicitly installed content-addressed extension packages under `data/extensions/packages/`.
`state/` holds runtime records such as task metadata, append-only status events, endpoint signals, watcher and wake-queue coordination, inactive terminal-outcome receipts under `state/terminal-outcomes/`, enabled extension working namespaces under `state/extensions/`, away-mode state, generated Relay artifacts, parent-side remote ledger copies under `state/secondmate-summary-cache/`, one-shot Bearings reconcile requests under `state/reconcile-notify/`, private secondmate config-reread generations with their retry and quarantine state, per-task steering-inbox records under `state/<id>.inbox/` (`bin/fm-task-inbox-lib.sh`), and parent-owned secondmate pending-reply records under `state/pending-replies/` (`bin/fm-pending-reply-lib.sh`).
`config/` holds local gitignored operating choices, including explicit extension bindings under `config/extensions.d/`, and `projects/` holds the local project clones that Firstmate reads but changes only through the narrow guarded and concrete captain-approved exceptions in `AGENTS.md`.
Untracked files and directories whose names begin with `scratchpad` are also gitignored, so temporary scratch does not make porcelain-based secondmate sync guards treat a home as dirty.

`bin/fm-spawn.sh` owns the base task-metadata fields it emits, while the runtime-backend section below owns backend-specific fields and selector interpretation.
`bin/fm-contributions.sh` owns durable published-contribution records under each task, observation bounds, equivalent triage-label configuration, and the authenticated contribution check.
The producing PR and Relay helpers own the fields they append, [`bin/fm-classify-lib.sh`](../bin/fm-classify-lib.sh) owns status-event vocabulary, optional emission-time syntax, and legacy unknown-time handling, and `bin/fm-crew-state.sh` owns current-state reconciliation.
The [`bin/fm-fleet-snapshot.sh` header](../bin/fm-fleet-snapshot.sh) owns the snapshot's event-time and age fields, including secondmate parent-event projections.
Wake, watcher, away-mode, and Relay-specific state mechanics remain with their named scripts and reference sections rather than being duplicated into one exhaustive state tree here.

`bin/fm-session-start.sh`'s header is the single owner of session-start ordering, composed commands, digest contents, and the digest's startup mechanism.
`bin/fm-startup-network.sh`'s header owns the deferred startup stage that keeps every external-network call and the potentially slow inactive-outcome scan off that digest's blocking path, including its state files and the safety argument for running them later.
`docs/sessionstart-nudge.md` owns the native session-open adapter tiers that run or nudge the digest command, and the source routing between them.
`AGENTS.md` retains the run-once and read-once operator rules, lock-refusal safety, installation consent, and direct-report recovery boundaries because those facts apply at every session start.
Ordinary dead-direct-report recovery is owned by `stuck-crewmate-recovery`, while persistent-secondmate recovery is owned by `secondmate-provisioning`.

## Calm preference (config/calm)

The Pi Calm extension and the Claude Code Calm mod share the captain's home-local presentation choice in gitignored `config/calm` under the effective Firstmate home, so one `/calm` choice applies on either harness.
Both resolve that home from `FM_HOME`, then `FM_ROOT_OVERRIDE`, then the tracked code root derived from their own path under it, or use `FM_CONFIG_OVERRIDE` as the config directory outright when that test and specialized-setup override is present.
The values they write are `on` and `off`, each followed by one newline; an absent, unreadable, or unrecognized value defaults to off.
`max` is the legacy value written by a removed third presentation level whose behavior is now ordinary Calm, and it is still read as `on`, so a home upgraded from it keeps Calm on rather than dropping to off.
Each `/calm` command persists the new choice before changing live presentation, so a failed write leaves the current choice unchanged rather than claiming persistence; Pi replaces the file atomically, while the Claude Code mod writes it through the plugin API's plain file write.
The Pi extension reloads this preference on every Pi `session_start`, including startup, new, resume, fork, and reload reasons.
The Claude Code mod likewise reloads it on every `session.start`, including same-process session replacement, and also loads it lazily before any row that can draw ahead of that event, including during `claude --continue` restoration.
This preference is local to each Firstmate home and is not part of secondmate inherited configuration.

## Pi supervision branch

On a Pi primary, an in-process supervision branch handles eligible task-local wake rows and selected heartbeat reviews while keeping main-only rows on the captain-facing path; [docs/pi-supervision-branch.md](pi-supervision-branch.md) owns its conversation lifecycle, row eligibility, mixed-queue dispatch, heartbeat routing, and pre-drain recheck.
Supervision is default-on: once a Pi primary session owns this home's fleet lock, the branch is eligible for every task with no captain grant file required.
A genuinely no-op heartbeat is absorbed in bash and never reaches Pi, and every watcher-failure alarm stays on the captain-facing main path.
A broken branch still falls back to today's wake-to-main path in both postures, and the legacy `state/.afk` daemon flag means nothing on Pi.
While the away-posture record `state/.afk-contract` exists the branch takes every actionable row, no processing turn opens on the parked main, and main's standing authority relocates to the branch through the guarded scripts, each keeping its own gate; [docs/pi-supervision-branch.md](pi-supervision-branch.md#postures) owns that posture.
While attended the branch's role stays bounded exactly as the captain-approved architecture set it: it cannot merge a PR, land local work, freshly spawn, or answer a decision, and every existing captain gate remains unchanged in either posture.
Homes on other primary harnesses do not load the Pi branch extension; shared per-task lease behavior is owned by `bin/fm-lease-lib.sh`.
`AGENTS.md`'s `state/` inventory routes the branch's runtime files to their format and lifecycle owners.
While attended, a captain-facing (verdict `captain`) branch outcome persists as one exact, sequence-keyed visible transcript entry and then opens one sequence-keyed processing turn on main, which stays open until main acknowledges that sequence through its `fm_branch_processed` tool; while away, the entry persists but processing waits until the record is archived.
The branch prompt's "Verdict: routine or captain" section owns the distinction between captain-facing, unsolicited routine, and unchanged-review outcomes.
The generated [Pi supervision protocol](supervision-protocols/pi.md) owns main's event ownership, acknowledgement duty, and conversational treatment for merged outcomes, while the persisted entry itself owns captain visibility.
A no-change heartbeat outcome explicitly reported with `task=fleet` and `silent=true` is delivered silently with no rendered note, while every other routine outcome still appends a rendered, sailboat-prefixed note.

## Pi supervision branch model and effort (config/supervision-branch-model, config/supervision-branch-effort)

Supervision is an easier job than the captain's own conversation, so the branch can run on a cheaper model than main.
It is also an easier job than the captain's own conversation needs reasoning for, so the branch can run at a shallower effort than main as well.
The Pi `/supervision-model` command settles both in one flow: it opens a selector over the models that Pi reports with configured credentials and that this home's stored credentials let the isolated supervision branch resolve, plus a first "Follow main" entry, and then a second picker for the branch's reasoning effort.
In Pi's terminal TUI, the model step uses Pi's bounded scrolling list with its input and fuzzy filtering primitives, the same list primitive Pi's `/model` picker scrolls: typing filters the entries, "Follow main" stays the first entry whenever it still matches, and a long catalog scrolls inside the dialog instead of running off the terminal.
The non-TUI RPC, JSON, and print modes have no custom-component surface and keep Pi's generic selector without search, where terminal overflow does not apply.
The effort list is a handful of levels and stays on Pi's plain selector dialog.
Both picks change the supervision branch alone and never the captain's own conversation model or effort.
It persists the model pick in gitignored `config/supervision-branch-model` and the effort pick in gitignored `config/supervision-branch-effort`, both under the effective Firstmate home, resolved from `FM_HOME`, then `FM_ROOT_OVERRIDE`, then the tracked code root derived from the extension path, or under `FM_CONFIG_OVERRIDE` when that test and specialized-setup override is present.
Firstmate keeps no model catalog of its own; the list is the intersection of what Pi reports when the picker opens and what a fresh isolated branch runtime can run.
A provider that exists only because an extension registered it inside the captain's session, such as pi-devin-auth's `devin`, is offered and can be pinned or followed like any other; [pi-supervision-branch.md](pi-supervision-branch.md#cost-model-and-the-byte-stable-prefix) owns how that registration reaches the isolated branch runtime.
Stored OAuth and API-key credentials retain their native credential type because Firstmate never copies, converts, installs, or overwrites credentials for the branch runtime.
The file holds one `<provider>/<model-id>` line followed by one newline, split at the first `/` so a provider-qualified model id such as `openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` survives intact.
An absent, unreadable, or unparseable file means no pin, and the branch then follows main's own current model, applied explicitly and live whenever main changes models mid-session.
When main uses `codex-native`, following main explicitly selects the same model through ordinary Pi's `openai-codex` provider, so the background branch owns an independent Pi conversation.
If that ordinary Pi model is unavailable, the branch refuses to build and returns the notification to main; it never inherits the main native thread or silently selects a different model.
Picking "Follow main" under a `codex-native` main reports that same `openai-codex` model, or that same refusal, because the command and the branch build share one follow rule.
A `codex-native` branch pin is refused and excluded from the picker.
A valid pin wins over main and remains unaffected by main's model changes.
Picking "Follow main" removes the file, and the command writes a pin at mode `0600` and replaces it atomically so a failed write leaves the current choice unchanged rather than claiming persistence.
The file's current state decides the branch model on every branch build - the new conversation each main session start opens and the reopen after a model or effort change inside one session - and it overrides Pi's restore of whatever model a reopened branch session recorded, so the choice survives all of them.
That override is what keeps "Follow main" honest: a branch conversation that ran under an earlier pin still records that model, so clearing the file explicitly applies main's model rather than letting the reopened session restore the old one.
For ordinary Pi providers, only when main's own model is unknown, or this home's stored credentials cannot run it in the isolated branch runtime, does an unpinned build fall back to passing no override at all, which is the behavior from before this file existed; the wake is never lost over model choice, and the command says plainly when main's model could not be applied instead of reporting a change that did not take effect.
A pin naming a model Pi cannot hand back, because the model is unknown or has no configured credentials, is never silently downgraded onto main's model: the branch refuses to build and rejects the accepted wake to the watcher's captain-facing main path, exactly as any other unreachable branch does.
Picking also releases the live branch so the next wake reopens this session's own branch conversation under the new model without waiting for a session replacement.

The effort file holds one Pi thinking level followed by one newline, and the two pins are independent: a captain may pin a model, an effort, both, or neither.
The effort step runs after the model step because the effective branch model decides which levels exist: its menu is Pi's own supported-level list, so a model that maps no extended levels simply does not offer them and a non-reasoning model offers only `off`.
The picker keeps no effort catalog of its own; when main's model cannot be resolved, it first resolves the model recorded by the most recent branch conversation and uses Pi's supported levels for that effective model.
If neither model can be resolved, the picker invents no levels and the command says that the branch's effective effort cannot be determined.
An absent, unreadable, or unrecognized file means no effort pin, and the branch then follows main's own current effort, applied explicitly and live whenever main changes effort mid-session.
A valid pin wins over main and remains unaffected by main's effort changes.
Picking "Follow main" removes the file, and the command writes an effort pin at mode `0600` and replaces it atomically, exactly as it writes a model pin.
The effort file's current state decides the branch effort on every branch build, on the same create-and-reopen contract as the model pin and for the same reason: a reopened branch conversation records the effort it last ran under, so only an explicit override keeps "Follow main" honest.
Only when main's own effort cannot be read either does an unpinned build fall back to passing no effort override at all, which is the behavior from before this file existed.
Pi owns the clamp, so a pinned level the branch's model cannot run becomes that model's nearest supported level rather than a refusal; the branch is never refused over effort, the captain's raw pick is kept so it applies again on a model that supports it, and the command reports the level the branch will really run at rather than the raw pin.
An effort token Pi would not recognize at all is treated as no pin rather than passed to that clamp, which would otherwise collapse a typo into the model's lowest level.

Cancelling the model picker cancels the whole command and changes neither choice.
Cancelling only the effort picker keeps the standing effort choice and still applies the model pick made in the same run, and the command's one closing message reports both choices as they will actually take effect.
Both choices are local to each Firstmate home and are not part of secondmate inherited configuration, the same as the Calm preference; a secondmate home pins its own supervision model and effort with its own `/supervision-model`.

## Supervision host (config/supervision-host)

The optional local, gitignored `config/supervision-host` opts this home into the supervision host, which runs the supervision branch's contract on a headless engine session beside a non-Pi primary; [docs/supervision-host.md](supervision-host.md) owns the design, its current scope, and the verified engines.
Today a Claude, Cursor, OpenCode, omp, Grok, or Codex primary runs it, and only for the away posture: with the file present, that primary's arm owner runs the host in the watcher arm's place, the host handles wakes on the engine while the away-posture record `state/.afk-contract` exists, and `/afk` launches no away daemon on that home, while `/quiet` still does.
Absence leaves the home exactly as it is without the host, on every harness; a Pi primary keeps its in-process supervision branch whether or not the file exists.
A Grok primary reads the file when its session-start block renders, so a change takes effect at its next session start; every other owner reads it at every arm.
The file may be empty, or hold one line `<engine> [<model>]`:

- empty or `default` selects the primary harness's own engine at that engine's default model (`sonnet` for the Claude engine);
- `<engine> [<model>]` names a verified engine, currently only `claude`, and optionally the engine's own model name or alias; `default <model>` selects the primary harness's engine with that model.

Only Claude has a verified engine of its own, so a Cursor, OpenCode, omp, Grok, or Codex home names `claude` in the file.

An engine that is not verified, a primary with no verified engine, or a malformed line leaves the host with no engine: it takes no wake, every wake reaches main as it would without the host, and each away-posture wake carries a line naming the problem.
The file is read at every wake, so a change applies at the next one without a restart.
It is local to each home and not part of secondmate inherited configuration.
While the file exists, main's lease-checked commands also take the per-task lease lock, so a claim by the host's engine cannot race a mutation main already started (`bin/fm-lease-lib.sh`).

## Backlog backend (.tasks.toml / config/backlog-backend)

The tracked `.tasks.toml` pins the default `tasks-axi` markdown backend to `data/backlog.md`, with `done_keep = 10` and an archive at `data/done-archive.md`.
A home may instead select another tasks-axi adapter such as Beads through its own `.tasks.toml` or `TASKS_AXI_BACKEND`; firstmate still uses only tasks-axi verbs for routine backlog reads and mutations, and the adapter maps `start` and evidence-bearing `done` transitions to its native statuses and evidence fields.
Captain-hold row creation is owned by [`bin/fm-captain-hold.sh`](../bin/fm-captain-hold.sh) `hold`: when no work item exists, it creates an ordinary backlog row (`--kind captain` metadata; Beads native type `task`) and then applies the captain hold.
Captain rows have no Beads due semantics, so that create path waives a Beads `due.required` setting rather than passing a synthetic `--due`; `--until` remains the optional hold deferral.
Do not register a Beads `types.custom` `captain` type for this: captain is a hold kind, and the fleet Beads `due.required` policy for ordinary work stays in the federated beads config.
When the automatic transition gate applies, dispatch and completion are not separate operator actions: each moves its work item inside the same run that creates or removes the task's record, so the ordinary successful path cannot leave the backlog and live task set out of sync ([`bin/fm-backlog-transition-lib.sh`](../bin/fm-backlog-transition-lib.sh)).
Under that gate, dispatch accepts only an unheld, unblocked Queued or In flight item in this home; a missing, Done, held, or dependency-blocked item is refused before any endpoint or local copy is created.
[`bin/fm-tasks-axi.sh`](../bin/fm-tasks-axi.sh) refuses `add --start` and its `create --start` alias so neither spelling places a row In flight without dispatch artifacts, because such a row would have no task record, status file, or inbox and would count as live work nobody is doing; `tasks-axi start <id>` remains a documented direct transition the wrapper passes through.
Completion refuses to report success until the item is closed, and session start reconciles this home's own books after an interrupted run.
When a spawn is interrupted after launch delivery began, its exit path re-reads the paired task record and the backlog row under the same per-task lock as the commit, repairs a row the commit believed it had moved, and reports only what was verified or honestly attempted, never intent phrased as outcome ([`bin/fm-spawn.sh`](../bin/fm-spawn.sh); [`tests/fm-backlog-atomicity.test.sh`](../tests/fm-backlog-atomicity.test.sh)).
Automatic transitions run from the configured data directory's parent, letting that home's effective tasks-axi configuration address its selected adapter while keeping relative scout-report links rooted there.
A markdown backlog is additionally addressed by an explicit `--file` at `<data>/backlog.md`, so the change lands in the home that owns the task regardless of the caller's working directory.
Any other configured adapter is addressed by that root alone, because `--file` would override the adapter's own workspace path.
The gate does not apply to persistent secondmates, manual-backend homes, or markdown homes without a backlog file, preserving their existing persistent-agent, manual, or ad-hoc lifecycle behavior while configured non-markdown adapters remain active without that file.
Migrated-hold resolution on a beads home reads its graph path, binary, and prefix from the root `.tasks.toml` `[beads]` section only, and refuses (rc=2) when the beads backend is selected elsewhere (a `TASKS_AXI_BACKEND` override or user-level config) with no root-level `[beads]` section.
On an automatic-backend home, missing or incompatible `tasks-axi`, an unresolvable configured data directory, or one containing a control byte fails lifecycle work before mutation.
An unreadable backend configuration can refuse lifecycle work before the no-backlog exemption applies; repair the configuration named in the diagnostic ([backend resolution contract](../bin/fm-tasks-axi-lib.sh)).
Secondmate handoffs bypass that routine-backend choice: `fm-backlog-handoff.sh` keeps only its own fleet-level validation and delegates the item move to `tasks-axi mv`; its [script header](../bin/fm-backlog-handoff.sh) owns route-specific wake outcomes and remote outbox release.
It moves in-scope `## Queued` items only and refuses `## In flight` and historical `## Done` records, which stay with their home for pruning or archiving.
Handoff item bodies must use at least two leading spaces, and the helper refuses a selected item with a single-space or tab-indented continuation rather than risk orphaning it.
Because bootstrap requires `tasks-axi` on `PATH` on every profile, that delegation works fleet-wide, and the `config/backlog-backend=manual` knob governs firstmate's own hand-editing of its backlog, not this validated helper.
Compatible means the installed build passes the shared version and feature probe owned by [`bin/fm-tasks-axi-lib.sh`](../bin/fm-tasks-axi-lib.sh), including the atomic multi-ID move required by handoff delegation.
Bootstrap requires compatible `tasks-axi` on every profile; see "Toolchain" below for missing-tool reporting and silent default-backend behavior.
Set the local, gitignored `config/backlog-backend` file to `manual` to force manual backlog editing and suppress the verbose `BOOTSTRAP_INFO: tasks-axi available` fact, not missing-tool reporting.
A `manual` home owns its backlog file outright: the lifecycle transitions above are skipped there, dispatch and completion never fail over the file's contents, and a completed teardown prints the hand edit that is owed instead.
Absent or `tasks-axi` selects the tasks-axi path.
On the default markdown adapter, tasks-axi and manual edits produce the same `## In flight`, `## Queued`, and `## Done` sections.

The tracked `.tasks.toml` paths resolve against the directory tasks-axi runs in, not `FM_HOME`, so a bare `tasks-axi` run from the code root addresses the code root's `data/` whenever the home lives elsewhere.
tasks-axi writes by renaming a temp file over its target, which replaces a symlink with a regular file, so linking the code-root copy into the home forks the queue on the first such write rather than keeping the two in step.
Every routine firstmate backlog command therefore runs through [`bin/fm-tasks-axi.sh`](../bin/fm-tasks-axi.sh), which addresses this home's backlog and archive from any working directory exactly as lifecycle transitions do, and bootstrap reports a code-root `data/backlog.md` or `data/done-archive.md` that is not this home's own file as a `BACKLOG_RECONCILE: code-root ...` line even in a read-only session.

## Runtime backend (config/backend / FM_BACKEND)

For spawn-capable adapters, the runtime session-provider backend controls where task windows/endpoints are created, captured, sent to, watched, and killed.
`tmux` is the verified reference backend (see [`docs/tmux-backend.md`](tmux-backend.md)); `herdr` has its own required CI lane (see [`docs/herdr-backend.md`](herdr-backend.md)); `zellij`, `orca`, and `cmux` remain experimental spawn backends with no dedicated real-backend CI lane (see [`docs/zellij-backend.md`](zellij-backend.md), [`docs/orca-backend.md`](orca-backend.md), and [`docs/cmux-backend.md`](cmux-backend.md)).
Treehouse remains the worktree provider for tmux, herdr, zellij, and cmux, since herdr, zellij, and cmux are session providers only; Orca provides both the task worktree and terminal endpoint.
New spawns choose the backend in this order: an explicit `--backend` flag that current authority for that exact task alone has authorized (a present captain instruction or the task's own accepted brief; never later-task precedent by analogy), then `FM_BACKEND`, then the first non-empty line of local gitignored `config/backend`, then runtime auto-detection from `$TMUX`, `HERDR_ENV=1`, or cmux runtime signals, then default `tmux`.
If more than one runtime marker is present, detection resolves innermost-first: `$TMUX` is checked before `HERDR_ENV=1`, which is checked before cmux's primary `CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID` marker and its documented fallback signals - tmux or herdr started from inside a cmux terminal is the innermost, currently-executing layer, while cmux itself (a terminal application, not a nestable multiplexer) is always checked last.
See [`docs/cmux-backend.md`](cmux-backend.md#runtime-detection) for why cmux can be selected when `CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID` is absent.
Auto-detected Herdr stays silent like tmux, while auto-detected cmux prints a stderr notice naming `config/backend` and `--backend tmux` because cmux remains experimental.
Zellij and Orca are never auto-detected; select them by putting the name in a local `config/backend` file, by exporting `FM_BACKEND=<name>`, or by telling the first mate in chat.
Any value other than `tmux`, `herdr`, `zellij`, `orca`, or `cmux` is rejected until another adapter is implemented and verified.
`fm-spawn.sh` accepts `tmux`, `herdr`, `zellij`, `orca`, and `cmux` for ship and scout tasks; `backend=orca` and `backend=cmux` both still refuse `--secondmate` until secondmate launch semantics are designed for each.
`codex-app` is not an accepted runtime backend yet; [`docs/codex-app-backend.md`](codex-app-backend.md) owns the Codex App boundary.
The session-start secondmate liveness sweep and the watcher's secondmate liveness tick use the recovery-grade `fm_backend_agent_state` classifier where verified.
The comment above that function in `bin/fm-backend.sh` is the single owner of its detailed state contract and recovery authorization.
The compatibility helper `fm_backend_agent_alive` continues to collapse those detailed results to `alive`, `dead`, or `unknown` for older callers.
A herdr spawn additionally version-gates against the installed `herdr` binary's protocol and requires `jq`, refusing loudly on an incompatible or missing installation.
A zellij spawn additionally version-gates against the installed `zellij` binary's version and requires `jq`, refusing loudly when either is missing or the version is older than 0.44.
A cmux spawn additionally version-gates against the installed `cmux` binary's version, requires `jq`, and requires the control socket to be reachable and accessible (see [`docs/cmux-backend.md`](cmux-backend.md) "Setup" for the one-time socket-access configuration this needs; Automation mode is the recommended socket control mode, with Password mode supported via `config/cmux-socket-password`), refusing loudly and non-retryably on a `cmuxOnly`/unauthenticated socket.
A backend spawn refusal from a missing dependency, version gate, or unauthenticated socket is terminal for that selected backend; firstmate surfaces it as a blocker instead of silently retrying another backend.
Task meta records `backend=` only for a non-default backend; an absent `backend=` means `tmux`, preserving existing default-path meta files.
Every new task records `endpoint_task_id=` as the cleanup binding between the metadata filename and its opaque runtime endpoint.
A herdr task additionally records `herdr_session=`, `herdr_workspace_id=`, `herdr_tab_id=`, and `herdr_pane_id=`.
A zellij task additionally records `zellij_session=`, `zellij_tab_id=`, and `zellij_pane_id=`.
An Orca task additionally records `orca_worktree_id=` and `terminal=`, with `window=fm-<id>` kept as the shared firstmate alias.
A cmux task additionally records `cmux_workspace_id=` and `cmux_surface_id=`.
Task selectors for `fm-peek.sh`, `fm-send.sh`, and `fm-crew-state.sh` resolve centrally through `fm_backend_resolve_selector`.
A selector containing `:` is passed through as an explicit backend endpoint escape hatch.
Otherwise an exact task id matching `state/<id>.meta` wins before the legacy `fm-<id>` label fallback, so task ids that themselves start with `fm-` route to their own metadata instead of being stripped.
A metadata-routed selector returns the recorded backend target (`terminal=` for Orca, otherwise `window=`), and matching explicit targets can still recover the recorded backend when metadata contains the same endpoint.
Only metadata-routed task selectors carry secondmate-marker and Codex-harness context; explicit endpoint escape hatches do not.
These five sentences are the single owner of the task-selector vocabulary; backend guides and other documents point here instead of restating the resolution order.
`fm-teardown.sh <id>` takes a task id directly and validates the complete metadata-only endpoint identity before any runtime dispatch or cleanup mutation.
Missing, empty, duplicate, malformed, backend-inconsistent, or task-mismatched endpoint records are preserved and refused.
Legacy tmux metadata remains cleanup-compatible when its exact window name is `fm-<id>`; opaque non-tmux endpoints require their recorded `endpoint_task_id=` binding.
`FM_HOME` determines Herdr's home label: the primary home uses `firstmate`, and a secondmate home marked by `.fm-secondmate-home` uses `2ndmate-<secondmate-id>`.
[`herdr-backend.md`](herdr-backend.md#watching-and-task-containers) owns launcher-bound workspace placement, the label-only fallback, collision handling, and recovery behavior.
The local `config/herdr-presentation-spaces` file instead opts a home out of, or explicitly in to, Herdr's default-on disposable single-task visual projection; [Presentation spaces](herdr-backend.md#presentation-spaces) owns its accepted values, default, Herdr version floor, migration, behavior, safety limits, recovery contract, and narrow locked session-start cleanup of exact restored idle-shell children.
The setting is inherited into secondmate homes under the primary-authoritative contract owned by [`secondmate-provisioning`](../.agents/skills/secondmate-provisioning/SKILL.md).
For normal herdr operations, `HERDR_SESSION` selects the named session, but destructive test cleanup must not rely on `HERDR_SESSION` alone.
Use the explicit guarded cleanup path described in [`docs/herdr-backend.md`](herdr-backend.md) instead of `herdr server stop`.
For normal zellij operations, `FM_ZELLIJ_SESSION` selects the named session and defaults to `firstmate`.
Zellij has no per-home workspace split: primary and secondmate tasks share that one session, and visible tab titles are scoped by the active `FM_HOME` readable label plus a short hash of the resolved `FM_ROOT` path as `fm-<home-label>-<id>`.
Use the guarded cleanup path described in [`docs/zellij-backend.md`](zellij-backend.md) instead of `kill-all-sessions` or `delete-all-sessions`.
cmux has no session layer at all - one workspace per task, in whatever cmux window is open - and its socket password (when configured) is read from local, gitignored `config/cmux-socket-password` under the effective config directory, never committed.
The caller-facing label remains `fm-<id>`, but the actual cmux workspace title is scoped by the active `FM_HOME` readable label plus a short hash of the resolved `FM_ROOT` path as `fm-<home-label>-<id>`.
Test cleanup must use the guarded path in [`docs/cmux-backend.md`](cmux-backend.md#current-operation-and-safety), never enumerate-and-close every workspace.
`config/backend` is inherited into secondmate homes under the primary-authoritative contract owned by [`secondmate-provisioning`](../.agents/skills/secondmate-provisioning/SKILL.md).

## Away-mode supervisor backend (FM_SUPERVISOR_BACKEND / FM_SUPERVISOR_TARGET)

The `/afk` sub-supervisor injects escalation digests into firstmate's own pane independently of where new task endpoints are spawned.
It currently supports only `tmux` and `herdr` supervisor panes.
Set `FM_SUPERVISOR_BACKEND=tmux|herdr` and `FM_SUPERVISOR_TARGET=<target>` to override both axes explicitly; for herdr the target is `"<session>:<pane-id>"`.
Without overrides, backend detection uses `$TMUX_PANE` first, then `HERDR_ENV=1` with `HERDR_PANE_ID`, then falls back to `tmux`.
That keeps a tmux pane nested inside herdr on the tmux transport, matching the runtime backend's innermost-first rule.
Target detection uses `FM_SUPERVISOR_TARGET`, then `$TMUX_PANE`, then `"${HERDR_SESSION:-default}:${HERDR_PANE_ID}"` under herdr, then the legacy `firstmate:0` tmux fallback with a warning.
Selecting any other supervisor backend, including `zellij`, `orca`, or `cmux`, refuses at daemon startup instead of trying tmux injection primitives against a non-tmux pane.

## Away-mode wedge alarm channels (config/wedge-alarm)

When away-mode injection wedges past `FM_MAX_DEFER_SECS`, the sub-supervisor raises a loud, rate-limited alarm.
Beyond the durable `state/.subsuper-inject-wedged` marker and the tmux status-line flash, it attempts a configured backend-independent active alert that can reach the captain even when every pane and its backend status-line is unreadable.
`config/wedge-alarm` (local, gitignored) lists channel directives, one per non-empty, non-comment line; every listed non-`off` channel fires, best-effort.
`FM_WEDGE_ALARM_CHANNEL` overrides the file with a single directive.
Directives are `off` (a position-independent kill switch that disables every active alert), `auto`/`default`, `osascript` (macOS Notification Center banner), `herdr` (herdr UI notification), and `command:<cmd>` (run `<cmd>` via `sh -c`, summary on `$1` and stdin).
An absent file means `auto`, i.e. default-on on macOS: the alarm exists precisely so a wedged away-mode primary is never silent, and it fires at most once per max-defer window after a genuine wedge.
A missing or failing channel logs and falls through to the next, never crashing the daemon.
See [`wedge-alarm.md`](wedge-alarm.md) for the current channel reference, [`verification/supervision.md`](verification/supervision.md#wedge-alarm-channels) for active evidence, and [`examples/wedge-alarm`](examples/wedge-alarm) for a copyable config.

## Trace context propagation (config/trace-context / FM_TRACE_CONTEXT)

The optional local, gitignored `config/trace-context` presence flag enables default-off native W3C trace-context propagation.
`FM_TRACE_CONTEXT` overrides the file: `1`/`on`/`true`/`yes` enables, any other non-empty value disables, and unset or empty defers to the file.
Each locked home session resolves those inputs once, and all spawns from that home use the frozen decision until a new session starts.
When launching a Secondmate, the primary copies the presence flag into its home and passes the primary session's frozen decision as a non-empty `FM_TRACE_CONTEXT=on|off` override for the Secondmate's own session start.
A Secondmate on a remote route is covered the same way: the primary resolves and records that task's carrier, and the configured host exports it and receives the same enablement snapshot.
The presence flag is session-scoped enablement, so it transfers at launch and is left unchanged by live convergence into a running home.
See [`trace-context.md`](trace-context.md) for carrier semantics, supported routes, the manual fleet-restart requirement, the session boundary, and safety limits; `bin/fm-trace-context-lib.sh`'s header owns the exact mechanics, and [`verification/trace-context.md`](verification/trace-context.md) records repeatable evidence.

## Fleet activity ledger (config/fleet-ledger)

See [`fleet-ledger.md`](fleet-ledger.md) for the opt-in setup, record contract, and limits.

## Turn-end pane-churn absorb (config/turnend-churn-absorb)

The optional local, gitignored `config/turnend-churn-absorb` presence flag opts this home into a default-off third form of positive work evidence in watcher triage.
With it present, every referenced task must independently show positive work evidence, and an eligible bare turn-ended task that lacks authoritative proof may satisfy that requirement when its pane content changed since the previous poll.
It stays opt-in because the other two proofs read a verdict the harness itself vouches for while this one infers execution from rendered bytes; with the flag absent triage behaves exactly as it did before.
`FM_TURNEND_CHURN_ABSORB_SECS` is a positive integer number of seconds, defaults to `900`, and bounds how long one endpoint's turn-ends may ride that evidence before surfacing anyway.
An invalid value fails closed and surfaces the wake.
The bound is required rather than cosmetic because churn and pane staleness read the same pane.
The flag is a home-local supervision-noise preference and is not inherited by secondmate homes, which run their own crew mix.
[`architecture.md`](architecture.md) owns the triage contract and `bin/fm-watch.sh`'s `signal_turnend_panes_churned` owns the exact evidence and fail-closed boundaries.

## Parked-gate wait deferral (config/wedge-defer-parked-gate)

The optional local, gitignored `config/wedge-defer-parked-gate` presence flag opts this home into a default-off second form of wait evidence in the watcher's wedge timer.
With it present, a provably-working pane about to escalate is also deferred to the `FM_PAUSE_RESURFACE_SECS` recheck cadence when its crew's own current state is a validation gate whose answer is owed to the supervisor and whose decision for that run is still open, and the recheck names the supervisor and the action that clears the lane instead of reporting a suspected wedge.
It stays opt-in because the other evidence is the worker's own declaration about its own silence, while this is derived from a pipeline's gate state, so which lanes give up the escalation ladder for it is a home's choice.
With the flag absent the wedge timer spends no fold or current-state read for it, writes no record, and keeps the unchanged escalation schedule, reasons, and `demand-deep-inspection` wording.
The flag is a home-local supervision-noise preference and is not inherited by secondmate homes, which supervise their own crew and own that trade separately.
[`architecture.md`](architecture.md) owns the wait-evidence contract and which records may take the ladder away; `bin/fm-watch.sh`'s `wedge_wait_evidence` owns the exact derivation and its fail-closed boundaries.

## Gate defaults (.no-mistakes.yaml)

The tracked `.no-mistakes.yaml` sets `test.evidence.store_in_repo: true` and pins `commands.lint` to `bin/fm-lint.sh`, the same owner CI invokes.
Storing evidence in the repo publishes each run's test artifacts to the orphan `no-mistakes/evidence` branch and links them from the PR body, instead of keeping them on local disk under the no-mistakes home.
That branch shares no history with code branches, so evidence never enters a pushed feature branch or the default branch; the worktree's `.no-mistakes/` stays local and CI rejects tracked entries under that path.
The [`firstmate-coding-guidelines` skill](../.agents/skills/firstmate-coding-guidelines/SKILL.md#no-mistakes-test-configuration) owns why `commands.test` stays absent and targeted validation belongs to the evidence path.
`commands.test` executes code, so no-mistakes honors it only from the default-branch copy of `.no-mistakes.yaml`; a pushed branch cannot change what the gate runs.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the firstmate-specific local test policy and entry points.
Portable shard evidence and coverage rules are in [fm-test-portable-shards.md](fm-test-portable-shards.md); [herdr-backend.md](herdr-backend.md#destructive-lab-safety) owns the real-Herdr lane's isolation boundary, and [runtime-backends.md](verification/runtime-backends.md#herdr) owns active evidence.

## Captain Preferences (data/captain.md / data/captain-shared.md)

Domain-local preferences for one captain's fleet live locally in each home's `data/captain.md`; it is gitignored and printed in the session-start context digest after `data/projects.md` and optional `data/secondmates.md`.
Before changing it, inspect the current file and curate the matching bullet in place under the internal [`stow` skill's](../.agents/skills/stow/SKILL.md) tiering and archive contract; add a new bullet only for a genuinely new durable preference.
Shared captain preferences that apply across secondmate domains live only in the primary home's optional `data/captain-shared.md`.
`secondmate-provisioning` owns its propagation contract, including the required header, read-only secondmate copies, quarantine diagnostics, and the rollout rule that existing homes trim `data/captain.md` by hand after first propagation rather than deleting private content automatically.

## Operational learnings (data/learnings.md)

Fleet-local operational facts and gotchas live locally in `data/learnings.md`; it is gitignored and printed after the captain-preference files in the session-start context digest.
The file is created lazily on first learning and follows the internal [`stow` skill's](../.agents/skills/stow/SKILL.md) aging-tier and cold-archive contract: inspect the current file first and curate it instead of appending forever.
There is no shared learnings file by captain decision.

## Startup memory budget (config/startup-memory-budget)

`config/startup-memory-budget` is the primary-authoritative per-home allowance for the startup prompt-memory surface: `data/captain.md`, `data/captain-shared.md`, and `data/learnings.md` together.
The locked mutable bootstrap path materializes its visible default of `7500` estimated tokens in a primary home when the file is absent.
To select another allowance, replace the primary home's file with one valid positive value in the exact format below; the next locked bootstrap convergence or `bin/fm-config-push.sh` propagates it to registered secondmates.
A secondmate does not create an independent default and instead receives the primary value through the inherited-local-material contract in [`secondmate-provisioning`](../.agents/skills/secondmate-provisioning/SKILL.md).
The file must be one positive base-10 integer followed by exactly one newline in a regular, single-linked file beneath a non-symlinked `config/` directory.
Malformed, multi-line, symlinked, hardlinked, special, or otherwise unsafe values are rejected rather than treated as a default.
Use `bin/fm-startup-memory-budget.sh read` to validate and print the effective value, or `bin/fm-startup-memory-budget.sh report` to account for the three files.
The stable local estimate is `ceil(UTF-8 bytes / 3)` per file, a conservative portable approximation rather than a provider-exact tokenizer.
An inherited `data/captain-shared.md` counts in a secondmate's total but remains primary-owned and read-only there.
The internal [`/stow` skill](../.agents/skills/stow/SKILL.md) owns curation and its automatic secondmate cascade, which accounts every home against this same per-home allowance separately rather than against a fleet total.
The helper's header owns exact parsing, publication, and report output mechanics.

## Stow pass horizon (config/stow-pass-horizon)

`config/stow-pass-horizon` is an optional local, gitignored presence flag that opts this home in to the pass-count decay horizon in the internal [`/stow` skill](../.agents/skills/stow/SKILL.md).
Without it a `/stow` pass decays memory entries on their wall-clock horizons alone - 30 days for `aging`, 7 days for `perishable` - which is the default and unchanged behavior.
With it, an entry is also stale after 10 passes (`aging`) or 3 passes (`perishable`) that evaluated it without reinforcing it, whichever horizon it reaches first.
Opt in for a home that stows often enough that entries never sit unreinforced for a wall-clock horizon, so memory only grows against the startup-memory budget above; a home that stows rarely already exceeds its date horizon on a single pass and gains nothing.
The flag is per home and is not inherited by secondmate homes, because stow cadence is a property of the home doing the stowing.
Only the file's presence is read, so its contents are ignored; remove it to return to the default contract on the next pass.
The skill text owns the marker spelling, the tick order, and the reinforcement rule.

## Secondmate routes (data/secondmates.md)

Persistent secondmate routes live locally in `data/secondmates.md`.
The concise single-line route contract is owned by the [`secondmate-provisioning` skill](../.agents/skills/secondmate-provisioning/SKILL.md#routing-table), including the parser-compatible fields, one-sentence summary requirement, `home:` pointer to the seeded charter, and limit on extra registry prose.
A remote route adds `host:` and `root:` before the existing fields and places the whole secondmate home on that SSH host; it does not make ordinary workers remotely placeable.
[`remote-secondmates.md`](remote-secondmates.md) owns current remote setup, operation, and safety behavior.
Use `fm-home-seed.sh validate` to check the complete operational registry contract documented by the command itself.
The main first mate routes by reading those scopes with judgment; the project list is provisioning data, not exclusive ownership.
Use `fm-home-seed.sh <id> - {<project>...|--no-projects}` to lease a fresh local firstmate worktree for the secondmate home.
For remote provisioning, including supplied project origins, follow [Remote second mates](remote-secondmates.md#provision-a-route).
Use the deliberate `--no-projects` signal only for a firstmate-repo domain that needs no separate project clones.
It cannot be combined with a project list, and omitting both still fails loudly.
A project-less seed requires no existing project clones or `data/projects.md` entries in the home, so it refuses a populated-home conversion without changing that home.
A preexisting project-bearing charter is also refused until it is re-scaffolded with `--no-projects` or removed.
The lease is held under the secondmate id until explicit retirement or seed rollback returns it, so normal restarts do not free or recycle the home.
Teardown of a leased home fails closed if `treehouse return` cannot release the lease; plain-clone homes with no treehouse pool slot are removed directly.
Secondmate routes cover `no-mistakes` and `direct-PR` projects; `local-only` projects remain main-firstmate work.
For `no-mistakes` projects, seeding initializes only projects newly cloned into a secondmate home and refuses to mutate a preexisting clone that is not already initialized.
After creating a secondmate, move existing main-backlog queued items that you have judged in-scope with `fm-backlog-handoff.sh <secondmate-id> <item-key>...`; it refuses In flight, Done, or non-secondmate homes, and its [script header](../bin/fm-backlog-handoff.sh) owns route-specific wake outcomes and retries.
Set `FM_SECONDMATE_CHARTER` to seed from inline charter text when no filled charter brief exists; set `FM_SECONDMATE_SCOPE` when the routing scope should differ from the charter text.
The seeded home's `data/charter.md` owns the standard secondmate lifecycle and escalation contract; the route file points to it through the existing `home:` field instead of adding another pointer.
Each seed writes an `.fm-secondmate-home` identity marker at the home root, alongside a durable `.fm-secondmate-parent` record of the home's route to its parent (see "Provision a route" in [`docs/remote-secondmates.md`](remote-secondmates.md)).
The tracked root `.gitignore` ignores both markers, so validation can read them without making a freshly seeded home appear dirty to porcelain-based safety checks.
This does not relax protection for any other untracked file.
An existing linked-worktree home that predates this rule advances through its marker-only state during its next bootstrap or spawn local sync, after which Git ignores the marker normally.
A local standalone-clone home cannot receive a primary-local commit through that no-fetch sync, so it receives the rule through `/updatefirstmate`'s origin refresh instead.

## FM_HOME

`FM_HOME` selects the operational home for one firstmate instance.
When it is unset, most scripts use the repo root as the home; when it is set, scripts still run from this repo's `bin/`, but `state/`, `data/`, `config/`, and `projects/` come from `$FM_HOME`.
`FM_ROOT_OVERRIDE` overrides the firstmate repo root used by scripts, including the primary checkout watched by the worktree-tangle guard.
When `FM_HOME` is unset, it also behaves as the old whole-root override.
`bin/fm-send.sh` is intentionally stricter than that general fallback: it requires `FM_HOME` to be set before resolving a target, so operator steers cannot silently resolve against the wrong home.
`FM_STATE_OVERRIDE`, `FM_DATA_OVERRIDE`, `FM_PROJECTS_OVERRIDE`, and `FM_CONFIG_OVERRIDE` override individual operational directories for tests and specialized harness setup.
Before `fm-brief.sh`, `fm-spawn.sh`, or `fm-afk-launch.sh` persists a path or passes it to another process, it resolves each applicable relative `FM_HOME`, `FM_STATE_OVERRIDE`, or `FM_DATA_OVERRIDE` directory against the caller's working directory, preserves accepted absolute spellings unchanged, and rejects an unresolvable relative directory with the offending variable named.
`fm-spawn.sh` additionally rejects control bytes in those raw directory inputs before shell or filesystem normalization can change which path the backlog gate checks.
Lifecycle access to a backlog, task record, or pending-close record must resolve within its configured data or state root, and a final-component symlink is refused even when its target remains within that root.
Bootstrap applies the same relative `FM_HOME` resolution only when embedding that home in the generated Relay poll shim; other transient consumers retain their existing shell-relative behavior.
For the herdr backend, `FM_HOME` also determines the workspace label used by the adapter.
For the zellij backend, `FM_HOME` does not split containers, but it determines the readable home prefix embedded in visible tab titles; use `FM_ZELLIJ_SESSION` when a separate zellij session is needed.
The full zellij home label also includes a short hash of the resolved `FM_ROOT` path.
For the cmux backend, `FM_CONFIG_OVERRIDE` overrides where `config/cmux-socket-password` is read from, while `FM_HOME` determines the default config path and readable home prefix embedded in workspace titles.
The full cmux home label also includes a short hash of the resolved `FM_ROOT` path, and there is no per-home container split.

## Harness support

claude, codex, opencode, pi, pi-signed, grok, kimi, cursor, and omp are empirically verified for crewmate and secondmate launches; gemini is verified for crewmate and scout launches only, and [README requirements](../README.md#requirements) own the set supported for the primary session.
`fm-spawn.sh` refuses kimi on cmux and Orca at preflight, because answering Kimi's folder-trust dialog needs a verified viewport-only capture those backends lack; [its adapter reference](../.agents/skills/harness-adapters/references/harness/kimi.md#readiness-gated-start) owns the trust-dialog handling.
A cursor secondmate or primary runs the tracked project-scope `.cursor/hooks.json` in its own home and must be launched with `--trust`, or no project hook loads; [`docs/supervision-protocols/cursor.md`](supervision-protocols/cursor.md) owns its supervision protocol.
Cursor typed-submit confirmation is verified on tmux and Herdr only.
On Zellij, cmux, and Orca a typed-plane Cursor send (a harness-native invocation or an explicit backend target; ordinary text steers ride the durable inbox and exit 0 at enqueue) lands, but `fm-send` reports delivery unconfirmed and exits non-zero because their shared submit core does not consult the busy footer; [runtime backend verification](verification/runtime-backends.md#cursor-agent-cli) owns the evidence and transcript-state boundary.
muse is verified for crewmate and scout launches ONLY, and `fm-spawn.sh` refuses it for a secondmate, because muse ships no usable hook surface for a primary session's turn-end supervision; [`docs/verification/muse.md`](verification/muse.md) owns that evidence.
muse also needs a worker-reachable credential before spawning, and the portable fleet path is the `<config>/muse/auth.json` credential stored by `muse login`, because a caller-only `META_API_KEY` does not cross a long-lived backend daemon.
gemini is likewise refused for secondmates because it has no primary supervision protocol; [its adapter reference](../.agents/skills/harness-adapters/references/harness/gemini.md) owns the credential precondition, canonical-launch wiring, and raw-launch limitations.
rovo is likewise verified for crewmate and scout launches ONLY, refused for a secondmate for the same reason - no turn-end hook and no primary supervision protocol; [`docs/verification/rovo.md`](verification/rovo.md) owns that evidence, including the OAuth token's silent background refresh from a stored refresh token and both tmux and herdr pane liveness (herdr placement is verified live, with a Herdr-side agent-detection gap left open for recovery classification).
agy is likewise verified for crewmate and scout launches ONLY, refused for a secondmate for the same reason - no hook surface and no primary supervision protocol; [`docs/verification/agy.md`](verification/agy.md) owns that evidence, including the spawn-time worktree trust pre-registration through `bin/fm-agy-trust.sh` and Herdr's native agy pane recognition.
devin is verified for crewmate and scout launches only; a secondmate is refused because Devin has no verified primary supervision protocol.
Its private worker config disables Claude Code imports (including the captain's hooks) and Devin commit attribution without editing user or project config; [`fm-devin-config.sh`](../bin/fm-devin-config.sh) owns these enforced settings and [Devin verification](verification/devin.md) owns the live evidence and observed model availability.
New harnesses get verified through a supervised trial task before joining the set.
The verified adapter evidence - each harness's busy-state source, interrupt and exit behavior, skill-invocation syntax, and per-harness quirks - lives in the skill tree rooted at [`.agents/skills/harness-adapters/SKILL.md`](../.agents/skills/harness-adapters/SKILL.md).
The executable interrupt and exit mechanics live in [`bin/fm-control-lib.sh`](../bin/fm-control-lib.sh), and [`docs/agent-control.md`](agent-control.md) owns their lifecycle-control architecture.
Launch mechanics, including the verified command templates, live in [`bin/fm-spawn.sh`](../bin/fm-spawn.sh).
Pi-family launches adapt the regular-TUI safeguard to the installed CLI's capabilities; [`fm-spawn.sh --help`](../bin/fm-spawn.sh) owns the exact version-safe launch mechanics.
Enabled primary-session turn-end guard integrations are tracked as repo-level hook files and documented in [`docs/turnend-guard.md`](turnend-guard.md).
Kimi remains outside the primary turn-end guard integrations; [`docs/turnend-guard.md`](turnend-guard.md#compatibility-limits) owns its separate captain-approved crew wake hook.
Primary-session watcher wake protocols are rendered at session start by [`bin/fm-supervision-instructions.sh`](../bin/fm-supervision-instructions.sh) from [`docs/supervision-protocols/`](supervision-protocols/).
Claude's Stop `asyncRewake` hook owns tokenless re-arm cycles, Cursor's stop hook parks on the watcher, Grok uses background-notify cycles, Codex uses bounded foreground checkpoints, Pi and pi-signed use the same two tracked primary extensions, omp uses its own two tracked `.omp/extensions/` files with a blocking `session_stop` turn-end hook, and OpenCode uses its TUI plugin.
`config/crew-harness` is a local, gitignored file containing one adapter name for crewmate and scout launches.
When pi-signed is selected, Firstmate preserves `FM_PI_HARNESS=pi-signed` and refuses the launch if the selected executable is unavailable rather than falling back to pi; [`fm-spawn.sh --help`](../bin/fm-spawn.sh) owns executable resolution and launch mechanics.
Plain Pi launches set `FM_PI_HARNESS=pi`, so a signed primary's environment cannot relabel a plain Pi worker.
When it is absent or contains `default`, crewmates mirror the firstmate's own harness.
`config/secondmate-harness` is a separate local, gitignored file containing the adapter the primary uses to launch secondmate agents, optionally followed by model and effort tokens on the same line.
The first non-empty, non-comment line is parsed as `<harness> [<model>] [<effort>]`.
A bare `<harness>` preserves the previous behavior: harness only, with no model or effort launch flag.
When the harness token is absent or `default`, secondmate launch falls back through `config/crew-harness` and then the primary's own harness, and no model or effort is read from that file.
`fm-harness.sh secondmate-model` and `fm-harness.sh secondmate-effort` expose only the optional tokens from `config/secondmate-harness`; `config/crew-harness` remains a bare adapter-name file.
Changing this pin affects the next secondmate spawn or control-plane relaunch; the relaunch profile rules are owned by [`docs/agent-control.md`](agent-control.md#transactional-relaunch).
An explicit harness argument to `fm-spawn.sh` still overrides either config file for that spawn only.
An explicit `--model` or `--effort` overrides the matching token from `config/secondmate-harness`; for a local route, an explicit harness or raw launch command starts with clean model and effort defaults unless those flags are also passed.
Remote secondmate routes accept verified harness adapters only and reject raw launch commands.
When `config/crew-dispatch.json` exists, crewmate and scout spawns require an explicit resolved harness instead of automatically falling back to `config/crew-harness`.
The inherited-local-material contract is owned by [`secondmate-provisioning`](../.agents/skills/secondmate-provisioning/SKILL.md); its harness-relevant consequence is that a secondmate's own crewmates use the primary's dispatch profiles and static harness value.
Those inherited values are defaults and rules only; `fm-spawn` still permits a consciously chosen explicit runtime outside the config.
`config/secondmate-harness` is not inherited because secondmates do not launch secondmates.
For grok, `fm-spawn.sh` installs one firstmate-owned global turn-end hook under `$GROK_HOME/hooks/`, or `~/.grok/hooks/` when `GROK_HOME` is unset, and drops a per-task `.fm-grok-turnend` pointer in the worktree, with teardown removing the task token and pointer.
For Kimi crews, `fm-spawn.sh` runs `fm-kimi-turnend-hook.sh install`, drops a per-task `.fm-kimi-turnend` pointer in the worktree, and records the matching private registry token for teardown.
Kimi continues to use the captain's normal Kimi home, including the existing config, skills, and memory; Firstmate does not create an isolated Kimi home.
The Kimi installer requires an existing regular non-symlink `~/.kimi-code/config.toml`, `python3` with `tomllib`, and `jq`; it validates but never serializes the captain's TOML and refuses before writing when the config is missing, malformed, or surprising or when either tool requirement is unavailable.
Its `remove` action excises only the marker-delimited Firstmate region and removes Firstmate's hook files.
For Pi and pi-signed secondmate launches, `fm-spawn.sh` starts the selected executable with `-e` pointed at the secondmate home's own tracked `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts` and `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts`, both already present from the secondmate home's git worktree.
For omp secondmate launches, `fm-spawn.sh` passes no `-e` at all: omp auto-discovers the home's tracked `.omp/extensions/` with no trust gate, and naming a discovered file with `-e` as well loads it twice; every omp launch instead carries the tracked `.omp/fm-worker-overlay.yml` posture overlay through `--config`, which [`fm-spawn.sh --help`](../bin/fm-spawn.sh) owns.

## Claude permission mode (config/claude-permission-mode)

The optional local, gitignored `config/claude-permission-mode` holds one token selecting the permission flag every Claude worker launch carries: crewmates, scouts, Claude secondmates, and control-plane relaunches alike.
The token is the file's whitespace-trimmed content.
`bypass` keeps today's launch, `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`, and is also the default when the file is absent, so an unconfigured home launches byte-for-byte as before.
`auto` replaces that flag with `--permission-mode auto`, Claude Code's classifier-reviewed permission mode, for a captain who refuses to run workers in bypass mode; every other part of the Claude launch, including its environment prefix, inline settings, model, and effort flags, is unchanged.
Any other value, or an unreadable file, refuses every spawn from that home, whichever harness it would launch, before any endpoint, worktree, or task record exists, and names the accepted values; Firstmate never falls back to a permission posture the captain did not choose.
`bin/fm-spawn.sh` reads the file on every spawn and relaunch, so a change takes effect at the next launch without a restart.
The file is a captain-wide safety preference, so it is inherited into secondmate homes under the [`secondmate-provisioning`](../.agents/skills/secondmate-provisioning/SKILL.md) inherited-local-material contract; a secondmate's own Claude crewmates then launch on the same posture.
The [Claude adapter reference](../.agents/skills/harness-adapters/references/harness/claude.md) records the verified shape of both launches and which once-per-machine dialog each one can meet.

## Worker account pin (config/claude-account, config/pi-account)

A home that mixes accounts for one runner, such as a work login and a personal one, can pin the account its own Claude and Pi workers launch on.
The pin is opt-in: with neither file, every launch is unchanged, and Claude workers keep receiving firstmate's own `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when it is set.
Both files are local and gitignored.

| Runner | File | Variable the launch receives | `ordinary` means |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `claude` | `config/claude-account` | `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` | the variable unset, so Claude uses its default login |
| `pi`, `pi-signed` | `config/pi-account` | `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` | `~/.pi/agent` |

`config/claude-account` holds one line: `ordinary`, or the absolute path of an existing Claude config directory.
`config/pi-account` holds that same root on line 1 and, on line 2, the providers this home may spend, separated by spaces, for example `openai-codex anthropic`.
A final newline is optional; any other line, a relative path, or a control character such as a CR refuses.
For Claude, `ordinary` unsets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` rather than pointing it at `~/.claude`, because Claude reads `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.claude.json` and keys its macOS Keychain entry to any directory that is set ([authentication, "Credential management"](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication#credential-management)).
A Pi root can hold several provider logins at once, so the root alone does not say which account a launch spends.
A pinned Pi launch therefore needs `--model <provider>/<id>` naming a declared provider, and Firstmate also passes `--provider <that provider>` so Pi cannot resolve the model under another signed-in provider.
An unqualified model, an undeclared provider, or a raw Pi launch command, which cannot receive that flag, refuses; Firstmate never guesses a provider.

When a file is present, every launch of that runner from this home uses it: ships, scouts, local secondmate agents, raw Claude launch commands, and relaunches.
A raw Claude launch command whose leading assignments set `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` or one of the credentials a pinned launch unsets, such as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, would override the pin, so it refuses and names the variable; remove the assignment from the raw command, or change or remove `config/claude-account`.
Before any worker endpoint, local copy, or task record exists, and before a relaunch stops the running worker, Firstmate asks the runner itself whether the pinned account is signed in: `claude auth status` for Claude, and `pi auth check --provider <provider> --json --no-refresh` for Pi, falling back to `pi --list-models <provider>` for a provider an extension registers.
The check runs with only `HOME`, `PATH`, `TMPDIR`, `USER`, `LOGNAME`, and the pinned root in its environment, so a credential variable in firstmate's own environment cannot answer for an empty root.
A pinned Claude launch also unsets the environment credentials Claude ranks above a stored login, such as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, and the Bedrock and Vertex switches ([authentication precedence](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/authentication#authentication-precedence)).
Pi ranks a root's stored logins above environment variables, so a pinned Pi launch unsets nothing.
A home that authenticates Claude through environment credentials on purpose should leave the pin absent.

A malformed file, a root that is not a readable directory, or a signed-out account refuses the launch and names the file to fix; Firstmate never falls back to the ambient account and never changes a global login or copies a credential.
The spawn prints the pin as `account=` (plus `account_provider=` for Pi) and records the same fields in the task record, so the session-start digest shows which account each worker launched on.
Pins are not inherited into secondmate homes: a local secondmate agent launches on the launching home's pin, while the secondmate's own workers read the secondmate home's files.
A remote secondmate is launched on its host from its own home's configuration, so create the file in that remote home.
[`bin/fm-worker-account-lib.sh`](../bin/fm-worker-account-lib.sh) owns parsing, the sign-in check, and the full list of credentials a Claude launch unsets; [runtime backend verification](verification/runtime-backends.md#worker-account-pin-sign-in-check) records the check against the real runners.

## Lavish server address (config/lavish-axi-host)

The optional local, gitignored `config/lavish-axi-host` contains one non-empty address without whitespace for the per-machine Lavish server.
`fm-spawn.sh` exports that address into every new worker and relaunch for opening boards, and the file is inherited into secondmate homes through the primary-authoritative configuration contract.
Once a board exists, the process-event adapter derives the polling address from that board's own saved Lavish session instead; its header owns the lookup contract.
When the file is absent, worker launches do not add a board address and retain the existing ambient-environment behavior.
Malformed or unreadable values refuse the launch before the worker starts.
The address selects the existing shared server; it does not authorize starting or stopping the server, and the Lavish startup crash remains a vendor-tool concern.

## Home brief include (config/brief-include.md)

The optional local, gitignored `config/brief-include.md` carries standing worker instructions that one captain wants on every ship and scout brief, so private brief content needs no edit to a tracked file.
When the file exists, `bin/fm-brief.sh` appends its text verbatim as the scaffold's last section, `# Home brief additions`, which defers to every other section of the brief, including the ship contract a later scout promotion appends below it.
An absent or blank file changes nothing, while a present path that is not a readable regular file, or text carrying its own `Delivery contract: mode=` line, stops the scaffold before anything is written.
The text is static and never executed or expanded; secondmate charters never take it, and the file is local to each home rather than part of secondmate inherited configuration.
`bin/fm-brief.sh`'s header owns the placement rule and its safety argument.

## Worker launch environment (config/launch-env-allowlist)

The optional local, gitignored `config/launch-env-allowlist` limits the ambient environment passed to newly launched workers, scouts, and secondmates, including relaunches.
With no file, ambient inheritance remains unfiltered: selected harness markers are cleared, while the provider, long-lived terminal daemon, and shell initialization determine which other variables reach the worker.
Do not assume every worker inherits the invoking Firstmate process's current environment.
The file is inherited into secondmate homes through the [primary-authoritative configuration contract](../.agents/skills/secondmate-provisioning/SKILL.md).
Changes apply to subsequent launches; existing processes keep their environment.

Create the file with one environment variable **name** per line, never credential values, assignments, wildcards, or shell commands.
Blank lines and lines beginning with `#` are allowed.
Invalid names, an unreadable or nonregular file, or a path inspection error (including an inaccessible configuration directory) stop the launch.
An empty file enables filtering with only Firstmate's operational floor.
For example, a provider using `OPENAI_API_KEY` and Git using an SSH agent could use:

```text
# Provider credential already available in the destination pane
OPENAI_API_KEY
# Git over SSH using an existing agent
SSH_AUTH_SOCK
```

Firstmate retains basic home, executable search, terminal, locale, temporary-directory, and backend routing variables, plus its explicit launch assignments, its ship and scout task marker, the compact-adviser kill switch described below, and enabled task trace.
[`fm-spawn.sh --help`](../bin/fm-spawn.sh) owns the exact retained names and parsing mechanics.
Other ambient names must be listed explicitly, including custom credential-store locations, proxy settings, and certificate overrides when required by the selected tools.
The command shell and worker may still create their own variables.
Allowed values come from the destination pane at execution time; they are neither copied from the invoking Firstmate process nor written into the launch command.
Listing a name does not provision it in a daemon's environment or transfer credentials to another machine.

Choose the minimum additions for the authentication method actually in use:

| Provider or Git transport | Additional names needed |
| --- | --- |
| Provider login stored under the normal home directory | None for the environment contract; the same user still has access to that provider's stored login. |
| Provider configured through environment variables | The exact credential and endpoint names required by that provider, for example `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; a multi-provider tool needs each provider it will actually use. |
| Custom provider store | Its configured location variables, such as `CODEX_HOME`, `GROK_HOME`, or `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`; Firstmate's existing explicit Claude and Muse store assignments still apply. |
| Muse environment authentication | `META_API_KEY`, already present in the target tmux session environment; Firstmate's preflight requires the stored-login path on other backends. |
| Git over SSH with an agent | `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`; add `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` only if the chosen transport requires that override. |
| Git over SSH with a key file | No credential variable when normal SSH configuration selects the key; file permissions and any passphrase handling still apply. |
| Git over HTTPS with a credential helper | Whatever the configured helper requires; a GitHub CLI helper using an environment token needs its selected `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN`. |

Verify the selected provider login and Git transport after opting in; Firstmate does not infer credentials from model names or install a secret manager.
Raw launch commands run under noninteractive POSIX `sh` with this option and must use compatible syntax.
The filter runs at the worker command boundary, after the terminal daemon and pane shell have started; it does not scrub either of those processes.
This is not a sandbox: it cannot revoke same-user access to credential files, prevent tools or later shells from loading credentials again, or isolate processes from the same user's other processes.
Regression coverage executes emitted launch commands with synthetic nonsecret values in [`tests/fm-spawn-dispatch-profile.test.sh`](../tests/fm-spawn-dispatch-profile.test.sh).

Every crewmate, scout, and secondmate Firstmate launches starts with `COMPACT_ADVISER_DISABLE=1` in its environment, on a fresh spawn and on a relaunch alike, so an unattended session never activates the compact adviser.
This guarantee also covers raw launch commands, remote secondmates, and launches filtered by `config/launch-env-allowlist`; it does not depend on the destination environment already containing the variable.
Firstmate provides no configuration or flag to change this value.
This applies only to agents Firstmate launches; the captain's own primary Firstmate session is never given the variable.
[`fm-spawn.sh --help`](../bin/fm-spawn.sh) owns the delivery mechanics, with focused regression coverage in [`tests/fm-spawn-compact-adviser-disable.test.sh`](../tests/fm-spawn-compact-adviser-disable.test.sh) and [`tests/fm-spawn-compact-adviser-disable-remote.test.sh`](../tests/fm-spawn-compact-adviser-disable-remote.test.sh).

Every claude launch's inline `--settings` JSON also carries `"attribution":{"commit":"","pr":"","sessionUrl":false}`, so a spawned worker never writes a Co-Authored-By trailer, Claude-Session link, or generated-with line into a commit or PR body regardless of which settings scopes end up loaded.

## Crew dispatch profiles (config/crew-dispatch.json)

`config/crew-dispatch.json` is an optional local, gitignored file containing natural-language rules that firstmate reads before dispatching a crewmate or scout.
The shell scripts do not match those rules; firstmate chooses the best matching rule with judgment, resolves its profile object or array under the operating contract in `AGENTS.md` section 4 and `quota-array-dispatch`, and passes only concrete `--harness`, `--model`, and `--effort` flags to `fm-spawn.sh`.
When the file exists, `fm-spawn.sh` enforces that contract by refusing crewmate and scout spawns that lack an explicit harness (`--harness`, a positional adapter, or a raw launch command).
Batch spawns satisfy the same requirement with a shared `--harness`.
Secondmate spawns are exempt and still resolve through `config/secondmate-harness` and its optional model and effort tokens.
This section is the single owner of the canonical schema and its per-field semantics.
`AGENTS.md` section 4 owns the always-loaded dispatch intake boundary, and `quota-array-dispatch` owns the completion-aware profile-array selection procedure.

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "when": "<natural-language condition describing a kind of task>",
      "approval": "captain",
      "min_confidence": 0.85,
      "floor": { "scope": "<quota-axi scope>", "min_percent": 20, "provider": "<quota-axi provider>" },
      "use": [
        { "harness": "<adapter>", "model": "<optional model>", "effort": "<low|medium|high|xhigh|max|ultra, optional>", "provider": "<optional quota-axi provider>", "floor": { "scope": "<quota-axi scope>", "min_percent": 50 } }
      ],
      "why": "<optional rationale that helps firstmate choose>"
    }
  ],
  "default": [
    { "harness": "<adapter>", "model": "<optional model>", "effort": "<optional effort>" }
  ]
}
```

Per rule, `when` and `use` are required; the top-level `rules` array itself may be absent or empty for a default-only configuration.
Both `use` and the optional top-level `default` accept either one profile object or a non-empty array of profile objects.
The single-object form stays fully backward-compatible, and every profile needs `harness`.
Profile `model` and `effort` fields and rule `why` are optional.
Rule `approval`, `min_confidence`, and `floor`, and profile `provider` and `floor` are optional declarations that only [typed dispatch resolution](#typed-dispatch-resolution-env-typesafe_api_key) applies in code; without that opt-in they are inert, and firstmate's own intake reads them as ordinary hints.
The resolver supplies the fixed neutral Choice option `No listed rule applies to this task.` for work that matches no listed rule.
`approval` accepts only `"captain"` and means a task the rule matches is never dispatched from the tool's answer alone.
`min_confidence` is a number from 0 through 1 that the rule's own probability in the answer must reach, in place of the resolver's global 0.6 floor on the answer's confidence; set it high on a rule whose wrong pick is costly and low on a rule that is a safe runner-up.
A rule `floor` names the quota-axi `provider` and `scope` whose `effectivePercentRemaining` must be at least `min_percent` for the rule's profiles to apply.
A provider-only rule floor on an expanded provider binds to its `default` account row.
An absent or unknown row or unmeasured provider makes the floor unverifiable and escalates without authorizing default routing.
A known percentage below the floor makes the tool resolve among `default` profiles instead.
A profile `provider` optionally names the quota-axi provider family whose rows apply to that profile; when present, profile and rule-floor provider IDs must match the strict whole-string pattern `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*\z`.
Bootstrap validates resolver-only `approval`, `min_confidence`, `floor`, and present `provider` values only while typed resolution is active; without the key those inert fields and the pre-existing verified-harness baseline preserve bootstrap behavior.
Typed resolution additively recognizes `gemini` because AGENTS.md section 4 verifies it for crewmate and scout dispatch.
The opted-in resolver has authoritative single-provider mappings for `claude`, `codex`, `grok`, `kimi`, `cursor`, `agy`, and `muse`; every other verified harness must declare `provider` explicitly, including multi-provider `pi`, `pi-signed`, `omp`, and `opencode` and unmapped `gemini`, `rovo`, and `devin`.
Its single-provider table is separate from the frozen legacy mapping used by `fm-quota-choose.sh`, so additions cannot alter no-key routing.
The resolver returns an actionable configuration error before any request when such a profile omits it.
A profile `floor` contains only `scope` and `min_percent`, always uses that profile's provider and matched account, and makes that one candidate ineligible below `min_percent` on the named scope.
An absent or unknown named row also makes the candidate unrankable and is reported as an unverifiable floor, not as a known shortfall.
`ultra` is native-only: the model-aware validation contract and launch mapping are owned by `bin/fm-harness.sh validate-native-effort` and `bin/fm-spawn.sh` respectively.
Codex `max` is valid when the profile selects `gpt-5.6-luna`, whose installed catalog entry supports that reasoning level.
An omitted model or effort means the selected harness uses its own default for that axis.
Every profile array is an implicit quota-aware choice resolved through `quota-array-dispatch`.
If no dispatch rule fits, firstmate resolves `default` through the same object-or-array path before falling back to `config/crew-harness`.
Except for `ultra`, which refuses unsupported profiles under the native-effort contract above, an effort value the chosen harness does not accept is recorded as `effort=` in task meta for traceability but omitted from the launch flags.
Bootstrap reports unsupported harness/model/effort combinations as a `CREW_DISPATCH` diagnostic when they are visible in the file.
See [`docs/examples/crew-dispatch.json`](examples/crew-dispatch.json) for a starting point to copy into local `config/crew-dispatch.json`; its Pi default declares the `claude` provider required for typed resolution of that Anthropic model.
When the file exists, bootstrap validates it with `jq`.
Valid files stay silent by default; with `FM_BOOTSTRAP_VERBOSE_FACTS=1`, bootstrap emits `BOOTSTRAP_INFO: crew dispatch active config/crew-dispatch.json`, one `BOOTSTRAP_INFO:` fact per rule, and one fact for the optional default profile set.
Malformed JSON, malformed rules, an empty or malformed profile array, an unverified harness, or an effort value unsupported by that harness is reported as `CREW_DISPATCH: invalid config/crew-dispatch.json - ...`.
While typed resolution is active, malformed `approval`, `min_confidence`, `floor`, and present `provider` declarations receive the same diagnostic; without the key those inert declarations preserve the pre-existing bootstrap behavior.
Missing `jq` is reported through the normal `MISSING: jq` install-consent flow.
While the file remains present, no crewmate or scout spawn may proceed without an explicit resolved harness; malformed configuration must be reported and corrected rather than selected around.
Secondmate homes inherit this file from the primary, so a secondmate's own crewmates apply the same dispatch profile behavior.

## Typed dispatch resolution (.env TYPESAFE_API_KEY)

`bin/fm-dispatch-resolve.sh` resolves one concrete crewmate or scout profile from a written brief with typesafe.ai's System One model (Jev), so the rule match that firstmate otherwise reasons out in its own context becomes one short tool turn.
It is off unless `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` is non-empty in the calling environment or the home's gitignored `.env` holds a `TYPESAFE_API_KEY=` line; the environment wins, matching the Relay and mail-plane contracts, and the Relay accessor in `bin/fm-env-lib.sh` reads the line.
Off means one `dispatch-resolve: off` line on stderr, nothing on stdout, exit 0, and no network call, so firstmate dispatches exactly as it does without the tool.
This section is the single owner of the tool's operator contract; the script header owns its exact flags and output lines, and "Crew dispatch profiles" above owns the declared rule and profile fields it applies.
Rules come only from the effective home's `config/crew-dispatch.json`; `FM_CONFIG_OVERRIDE` selects the config directory for tests and specialized setup like the other scripts.

```sh
bin/fm-dispatch-resolve.sh data/<id>/brief.md --project <name>        # TOON block on stdout
```

Firstmate invokes the resolve path directly after writing the brief, without a preflight; the absent-key off line is handled exactly like every other non-clear outcome.
When on and at least one rule exists, the tool sends the project name and the brief's task-specific text as state and asks one Choice question whose options are every rule's `when` plus the fixed neutral option for no matching rule; the model never sees quota, catalogs, `why`, `use`, approvals, or confidence floors.
The task-specific text is the brief's `## Captain's intent` and `## Firstmate spec` sections under `# Task` that `bin/fm-brief.sh` scaffolds, read by the same parser that feeds `fm-spawn.sh` validation and the no-mistakes `--intent` contract; a brief with neither section is sent whole.
When the sections are sent from a scout brief, the line `Brief kind: scout (report only)` comes first, taken from the scaffold's scout contract line; ship briefs and briefs sent whole get no kind line.
A ship brief's delivery mode is deliberately not sent, because in live runs naming it pushed a routine ship brief toward the hardest tier (see [the verification record](verification/dispatch-resolve.md)).
The scaffold's standard setup, rules, and definition-of-done text is the same in every brief, so leaving it out keeps its safety language from reading as a signal about the task.
An absent rules file, a default-only file, or `rules: []` returns the non-clear reason `no rules to match` without a model or quota request, leaving firstmate's existing routing in control; an existing but unreadable or malformed rules file, including a broken symlink, remains an actionable exit 2 configuration error.
Everything after the answer runs in code: the confidence floor, the matched rule's `approval` and `floor`, each candidate's `provider` and `floor`, every applicable account-wide and model/product row from one `quota-axi --json` snapshot, and the numeric `spendPriority` argmax over candidates using each candidate's limiting row.
The [shared quota library](../bin/fm-quota-axi-lib.sh) accepts schema 5 and schema 6 and implements the [account-matching contract](../.agents/skills/quota-array-dispatch/SKILL.md#1-eligibility).
An expanded provider with no matching account row leaves the candidate eligible but unranked.
Known applicable rows from a provider with partial quota semantics remain rankable; rows whose own status is not known remain unrankable.
A rule that declares `min_confidence` is checked against that rule's own probability, whether it is the picked option or a runner-up, so a runner-up never needs weaker support than it would as the pick.
A picked rule without `min_confidence`, and the neutral option, keep the global 0.6 floor on the answer's confidence exactly as before, so a file with no declared floors behaves as it did.
When the picked rule declares its own floor and its probability is below it, the tool takes the most probable other option whose probability clears that option's floor (a rule's `min_confidence`, otherwise 0.6), prints a `fallback:` line naming both floors, and resolves that rule as though it had been picked; no qualifying option, or two equally probable ones, is `ambiguous`.
Any applicable `exhausted_now` row or known zero bound makes that candidate ineligible, and a known profile-floor shortfall does the same before unrelated quota uncertainty is considered.
Missing or nonnumeric `spendPriority` evidence is never ranked, and every candidate is printed beside its evidence or the reason it was not rankable, including on ambiguous and approval-gated outcomes that emit no profile.
On the opted-in path, duplicate concrete profiles with the same harness, model, and effort inside one rule or the default array are configuration errors rather than ties.
The result is one of `clear` (a `profile:` line ready for `fm-spawn.sh`), `ambiguous` (confidence below the floor with no runner-up taken), `escalate` (an approval-gated rule, unverifiable rule floor, nothing rankable, or a genuine tie), or `error` (API, network, malformed response metadata, rendering, or quota-axi failure), and every one of them exits 0.
Response probabilities must contain exactly every offered choice, use numeric values from 0 through 1, and sum to approximately 1 within 0.01.
Only a usage or configuration error exits 2: an unreadable brief, an existing but unreadable or malformed canonical rules file, or missing `jq`, each reported and never selected around.
Missing `curl` is a normal structured `error` outcome with exit 0 so firstmate uses today's routing.
The tool never replaces firstmate's judgment, `quota-array-dispatch`, the captain-approval gate, or `fm-spawn.sh` validation; `AGENTS.md` section 4 owns what firstmate does with each outcome.
By accepted design, a `clear` result does not enforce catalog/authentication, reasoning-class, or completion-runway gates.
Firstmate passes its profile line unless it states a reason to override, such as the brief's reasoning class or an eligible-unranked-candidate note; every non-clear result returns to the full existing intake.

The resolver and bootstrap copy an environment-provided key into a non-exported private variable and unset `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` before launching child processes, so the secret is absent from child environments.
The resolver sends the key to `curl` only as a header read from a file descriptor, never on argv, and nothing prints, logs, or writes it.
The resolver fixes the endpoint at `https://api.typesafe.ai`, model at `jev-latest`, default confidence floor at 0.6, and request timeout at 5 seconds; `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` is its only resolver-specific environment setting.
The live rule-match evidence is recorded in [`verification/dispatch-resolve.md`](verification/dispatch-resolve.md).

## Toolchain

On session start the first mate detects what its required toolchain is missing or too old and lists each problem with either an exact install command or manual instructions.
It installs automatically supported tools only after you say go; manual-only tools remain for you to install from the printed instructions.
Required tools come in two parts: a universal toolchain every home needs regardless of backend, and a per-backend delta that follows the runtime backend actually resolved for this home.
The essential universal toolchain is node, git, gh with GitHub auth via `gh auth login`, no-mistakes v1.46.0 or newer, compatible gh-axi, chrome-devtools-axi, compatible tasks-axi per "Backlog backend" above, and compatible quota-axi.
[`bin/fm-bootstrap.sh`](../bin/fm-bootstrap.sh) owns the axi-family floor policy and the gh-axi and lavish-axi floors, while [`bin/fm-tasks-axi-lib.sh`](../bin/fm-tasks-axi-lib.sh) and [`bin/fm-quota-axi-lib.sh`](../bin/fm-quota-axi-lib.sh) hold their own tools' floor constants.
This section is the single owner of that universal toolchain list; backend guides' prerequisites point here and add only their backend-specific tools.
In that list, no-mistakes runs the validation pipeline, gh-axi and chrome-devtools-axi cover GitHub and browser operations, and tasks-axi plus quota-axi back backlog mutations and quota-aware array dispatch.
Lavish is a presentation-only dependency for visual decisions and reports; nonvisual work can proceed with plain text when it is unavailable.
The per-backend delta is required only for the backend resolved from `FM_BACKEND`, then `config/backend`, then runtime auto-detection, then default `tmux`, so a home is never told to install a tool an inactive backend or feature would need.
That delta is owned in code by `fm_backend_required_tools` in `bin/fm-backend.sh`: the resolved backend's own session-provider CLI (`tmux`, `herdr`, `zellij`, `orca`, or `cmux`), `jq` for the JSON-emitting adapters (`herdr`, `zellij`, `cmux`) whose spawn and liveness paths parse the backend's JSON output, and the `treehouse` worktree provider for every session-provider-only backend (`tmux`, `herdr`, `zellij`, `cmux`).
Backend tool availability uses the adapter's own executable resolver, so bootstrap and spawn agree on supported non-`PATH` locations such as cmux's bundled CLI.
An unknown resolved backend emits `BACKEND_INVALID` and blocks dispatch instead of silently dropping its dependency delta or falling back to tmux.
Orca provides both the task worktree and terminal endpoint (see "Runtime backend" above), so `backend=orca` requires only `orca` on top of the universal toolchain and skips both `treehouse` and every other backend's session CLI.
A herdr, zellij, or cmux home is therefore never told `tmux` is missing, and the `treehouse` durable-lease upgrade check runs only for the backends that actually use treehouse.
When `config/crew-dispatch.json` exists, bootstrap also requires `jq` for dispatch profile validation.
When Relay is opted in, bootstrap also requires `curl` and `jq` before arming the relay poll shim.
`tasks-axi` and `quota-axi` are essential bootstrap tools in every profile.
An absent or incompatible `tasks-axi` reports `MISSING: tasks-axi (install: npm install -g tasks-axi)`; when `config/backlog-backend` is not `manual`, a home with a configured non-markdown adapter or a markdown backlog refuses lifecycle mutation until compatible `tasks-axi` is on `PATH`, while a manual-backend home keeps its backlog hand-edited.
An absent or incompatible `gh-axi` reports `MISSING: gh-axi (install: npm install -g gh-axi && gh-axi setup hooks)`.
An absent or incompatible `lavish-axi` reports `PRESENTATION_UNAVAILABLE` with its required floor, install command, and explicit text fallback; [`bootstrap-diagnostics`](../.agents/skills/bootstrap-diagnostics/SKILL.md) owns the response and compatibility check before visual use.
An absent or too-old `quota-axi` reports `MISSING: quota-axi (install: npm install -g quota-axi)`; firstmate cannot resolve a profile array without a compatible binary.
Bootstrap also reports a `TANGLE:` line when `FM_ROOT` is on a named non-default branch; follow the printed checkout remediation rather than treating it as an installable tool problem.
In a read-only session that did not get the fleet lock, the same line is advisory and omits the checkout command.
The locked session-start deferred network stage runs bootstrap's best-effort project clone refresh through `fm-fleet-sync.sh`; [`fm-bootstrap.sh`'s header](../bin/fm-bootstrap.sh) owns the exact clone-refresh overlap, liveness-before-convergence, per-mate concurrency, ordered diagnostic replay, and sequential-fallback contract.
It emits `FLEET_SYNC:` for skipped refreshes that may matter, recovered self-heals, and `STUCK:` alarms.
Normal completed runs keep local-only and no-origin skips silent.
If bootstrap kills a timed-out refresh, it replays any completed `fm-fleet-sync.sh` output before the aggregate timeout skip so no finished result is lost.
A killed refresh (or a teardown process kill) can leave an orphaned `.git/packed-refs.lock` in a clone, which makes the next refresh's fetch fail with Git's `Unable to create '...packed-refs.lock': File exists`.
On that signature only, `fm-fleet-sync.sh` retries the fetch with a bounded wait for the lock to self-clear, then removes the lock and retries once more only when it can prove the lock stale, exactly like the `fm-teardown.sh` `index.lock` recovery.
It never removes a live lock, leaves any other failure shape untouched, and prints every wait, retry, and removal to stderr plus a one-line `recovered:` summary to stdout on success so that this session-start relay still surfaces the recovery.
The same deferred network stage performs guarded tracked-file sync and propagates declared inherited local material into each validated live home under that sequencing contract.
Local routes use direct guarded filesystem operations, while remote routes delegate sync and allowlisted transfer through their configured SSH host without probing any unconfigured fleet.
It emits `SECONDMATE_SYNC:` only when a home was skipped for an actionable sync reason, inheritance failed, or a divergent shared captain-preference copy was quarantined.
When a running home advances and its loaded instruction surface (`AGENTS.md`, `bin/`, or `.agents/skills/`) changed, bootstrap sends the re-read nudge itself through the stable `fm-<id>` selector and reports the exact completed send as `BOOTSTRAP_INFO:`.
If that send fails, bootstrap keeps an idempotent retry marker and emits `NUDGE_SECONDMATES:` with the failure reason.
The same bootstrap run emits `SECONDMATE_LIVENESS:` only when a registered secondmate is skipped or its relaunch fails; already-live and successfully relaunched secondmates are handled silently.
For a mid-session inherited local-material edit where tracked-file sync is not needed, run `bin/fm-config-push.sh`.
It uses the same live secondmate discovery and propagation helper as bootstrap; its [help](../bin/fm-config-push.sh) owns reporting and exit semantics, and [`fm_config_inherit_items`](../bin/fm-config-inherit-lib.sh) declares the inherited items.
When an allowlisted config item changes for an already-running local home, it sends the literal-content reread pointer described in [`secondmate-provisioning`](../.agents/skills/secondmate-provisioning/SKILL.md); unchanged allowlisted config sends no pointer unless a previous delivery is pending.
A changed remote home instead receives one durably recorded marked re-read instruction after the allowlisted bytes have transferred because primary-local generation paths are not meaningful on another host.
The locked bootstrap inheritance pass uses the same placement-specific behavior; see `secondmate-provisioning` for the single contract owner.
That live discovery starts from `state/*.meta` records with `kind=secondmate`; `data/secondmates.md` only backfills `home=` for older or incomplete meta records.
Skipped items, such as a destination checkout that does not yet gitignore the item, are visible warnings but not hard failures.

## Watched tool updates (config/watched-tools.json)

`config/watched-tools.json` is an optional local, gitignored list of the tools this home depends on.
When it is present and the check is armed, [`bin/fm-tool-update-check.sh`](../bin/fm-tool-update-check.sh) reports two conditions, and keeps them deliberately distinct:

- `<tool> update available` means a newer version exists at the tool's update source.
- `<tool> update not in effect` means a newer copy is already installed on this host, but `PATH` still resolves an older one.

The second condition is the reason the check exists.
An update can install correctly and stay inert because an earlier `PATH` entry still holds an older copy, and a check that only asks whether a newer version is published reports that host as up to date.
The script therefore runs every copy of a watched command found on `PATH` and asks it for its own version, rather than trusting one lookup or reading a version out of a directory name.
It only reports; it never installs, updates, fetches, or changes `PATH`, a version manager, or any installed tool.

This section is the single owner of the canonical schema.
`bin/fm-tool-update-check.sh` owns probe mechanics, cadence, and the report record.

```json
{
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "<label used in the report>",
      "command": "<optional bare executable name to find on PATH>",
      "version_args": ["<optional args that make it print its version, default --version>"],
      "announce_pattern": "<optional extended regex matching the tool's own update announcement>",
      "announce_args": ["<optional args for the command that carries that announcement, default version_args>"],
      "git": {
        "repo": "<optional absolute path to a local clone>",
        "remote": "<optional remote name, default origin>",
        "branch": "<optional branch, default the remote's own default branch>"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Each entry needs a `name` and at least one of `command` or `git`; an entry may carry both.
A `command` entry gives the `PATH` comparison above, and adding `announce_pattern` also reports the tool's own update announcement, which is how a tool that already reports its own updates is read rather than reimplemented.
A tool does not always announce a new release on the command that prints its version: `no-mistakes --version` prints only the version, while its other commands carry the announcement.
`announce_args` names the command to search for the announcement in that case, and it is asked only of the copy `PATH` resolves; without it the version probe's own output is searched.
An `announce_pattern` that is not a usable extended regular expression stops `arm`, and during a sweep it is reported as that one tool's own check failure so one broken pattern never stops the other watched tools from being checked.
A `git` entry reports how many commits the local clone is behind its remote branch, and stays silent when the clone is current or ahead.
An omitted `branch` uses the remote's default branch, taken from the clone's own record of it and otherwise asked of the remote directly, so a `--single-branch` clone still resolves.
Both probe kinds are read-only and bounded, and a probe that cannot answer is reported as a check failure rather than assumed current.
See [`docs/examples/watched-tools.json`](examples/watched-tools.json) for a starting point to copy into local `config/watched-tools.json`.

Arm the check once per home with `bin/fm-tool-update-check.sh arm`.
That writes `state/tool-updates.check.sh` and binds its bytes with `bin/fm-check-register.sh`, so the existing watcher polls it on its normal cadence and turns its one line into a `check:` wake; no separate schedule is involved.
Registering the check is itself a reason to watch, so the home keeps a watcher for it after the last task is torn down, and `disarm` is what ends that need.
`bin/fm-tool-update-check.sh disarm` removes the shim, its trust binding, and the report record.
The check prints nothing when everything is current, and `state/.tool-updates` records the findings the last report was made from so the same pending update is reported once instead of on every poll.
A changed or returning condition is reported again.
Adding, removing, or changing a watched tool is an edit to this file and needs no code change or re-arming.
This file is not inherited by secondmate homes, so each home watches the tools it actually depends on.

`FM_TOOL_UPDATE_INTERVAL` (default 900 seconds, `0` to probe on every run) sets how often probes actually run, `FM_TOOL_UPDATE_PROBE_SECS` (default 5) bounds one probe, and `FM_TOOL_UPDATE_BUDGET_SECS` (default 20) bounds a whole sweep.
A sweep that runs out of budget says which tool it did not reach rather than reporting the rest as current.
The sweep must finish inside `FM_CHECK_TIMEOUT` (default 30), because a run the watcher kills prints nothing and records nothing and would then repeat that silence on every poll.
So a budget larger than that timeout allows is cut down to what fits instead of being refused, and the cut is reported in the report line.
A budget that is not a whole number from 1 to 120 is still refused outright.

## Mail plane (.env)

The mail plane (bin/fm-mail.sh) reads unseen IMAP messages and sends one SMTP message.
Its `poll` command surfaces each new message as a durable `check: mail <uid>` wake, which is also what the standing received-mail check runs each watcher cycle.
Poll emission is exactly-once-recovering: a published wake always carries a durable journal record, and a poll interrupted before recording its uid is healed from that journal, so inbound mail is never silently missed.
A duplicate wake is possible if the process is killed between the queue append and the journal write and the drain acknowledges that row before the next poll heals it, or under a triple write fault that leaves a queued row with no durable record; neither case drops mail.
IMAP and SMTP use implicit TLS on the default ports 993 and 465 (`IMAP4_SSL` / `SMTP_SSL`).
STARTTLS and port 587 are not supported.
It is off unless the home's gitignored `.env` provides the connection values.
This section is the single owner of the mail-plane configuration schema; for direct invocations, environment values override `.env`, matching the Relay contract.

Required, in the home's gitignored `.env`:

```sh
FM_MAIL_USER=   # IMAP/SMTP login
FM_MAIL_PASS=   # IMAP/SMTP password
FM_IMAP_HOST=   # IMAP server hostname
FM_SMTP_HOST=   # SMTP server hostname
```

`FM_IMAP_PORT` (default 993), `FM_SMTP_PORT` (default 465), `FM_MAIL_TIMEOUT` (default 20 seconds), and `FM_MAIL_POLL_MAX_WAKES` (default 20, valid 1..200) are optional.
The per-poll wake cap bounds the wakes of one `poll` run; header fetches scan a larger bounded window of new unseen uids plus already-surfaced retry-set uids, so a flood or large backlog still makes bounded progress every poll, keeping the durable wake queue bounded without ever dropping mail.
A message whose header cannot be fetched is surfaced with a degraded summary instead of being skipped, so it is never missed and cannot block later mail.
A later poll retries that fetch and, on success, surfaces the real sender and subject; a persistently unfetchable message stays degraded without repeating that wake.

A home that wants mail polled unattended arms the standing check in the live home: `bin/fm-mail-check.sh arm`.
Arming writes `state/mail.check.sh` and registers it with the watcher's slow-check cadence (`FM_CHECK_INTERVAL`), so the plane's `poll` runs on its own: new mail still surfaces as `check: mail <uid>` wakes from the poll, and the standing check itself also prints a line (and the watcher turns that line into a wake) unless the poll is a proven no-op.
Same-line silence is only for a proven no-op: a successful poll with no new mail, or a repeated identical pre-wake failure that cannot have queued mail.
A fail-closed poll that already queued a wake, and a timeout, always print so the watcher wakes to drain it.
`FM_MAIL_CHECK_BUDGET` (default 15, valid 5..25) bounds one standing poll and is cut down to fit `FM_CHECK_TIMEOUT`.
`bin/fm-mail-check.sh disarm` removes the standing check.

## Relay (.env)

Relay lets a firstmate instance answer public mentions and act on normal reversible mention requests through firstmate's normal lifecycle.
It covers both public surfaces the relay supports: `@myfirstmate` mentions on X, and mentions of the myfirstmate bot in a Discord server where it is installed.
Both surfaces are the same opt-in and the same machinery - one pairing token, one relay poll, and one reply path - so everything below applies to Discord mentions unless a line names a platform explicitly.
It is off unless the firstmate home's gitignored `.env` contains a non-empty `FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN`.
The pairing token both identifies the relay tenant and records opt-in consent for autonomous public replies and eligible lifecycle actions.
Destructive, irreversible, or security-sensitive asks are flagged for trusted-channel confirmation instead of being executed from a public mention.
The relay uses owner-only routing: a mention delivered to a home is from that home's owner/captain, while its surrounding conversation context may still include other public accounts.
`FMX_RELAY_URL` is optional and defaults to `https://myfirstmate.io`, mainly for developers pointing at a local relay.
For direct client invocations, environment values override `.env`; bootstrap activation still keys off `.env` presence so watcher artifacts are explicit local opt-in state.
`FMX_ENV_FILE` can point direct poll/reply client invocations at another `.env`-style file, but it does not change bootstrap activation.

To turn it on:

1. Sign in at [myfirstmate.io](https://myfirstmate.io) with X or Discord.
2. For the Discord surface, use the dashboard's install link to add the myfirstmate bot to a server you administer; the X surface needs no install step.
3. Copy the pairing token from the dashboard into this firstmate home's gitignored `.env` as `FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN=<token>`.
4. Start a new firstmate session so bootstrap picks the token up, then mention `@myfirstmate` on X or mention the bot in a server where it is installed.

The dashboard owns account creation, identity linking, bot installation, and token issuance; this document owns only what the local firstmate home does with the token once it is in `.env`.

The locked session-start bootstrap step turns the token into local generated state.
It writes `state/x-watch.check.sh`, a byte-static identity shim for `bin/fm-x-poll.sh`, and `config/x-mode.env`, which exports `FM_CHECK_INTERVAL=30` for watcher processes in that home.
The watcher accepts the shim only when its bytes match the expected generated content, then invokes the trusted repository poll script directly instead of executing state-file source.
This section is the single owner of the Relay cadence contract: a Relay instance polls every 30 seconds instead of the default 300, only a Relay instance speeds up because a non-Relay home has no `config/x-mode.env`, and the session-start supervision operating block includes the cadence instruction when that file exists.
The active primary-harness supervision protocol owns how that sourced cadence reaches the watcher process.
Because `bin/fm-watch.sh` reads `FM_CHECK_INTERVAL` only at process start, a cadence transition - opt-in while a watcher is already running, or opt-out - is applied by restarting the home-scoped watcher through the emitted harness protocol; bootstrap deliberately never restarts the watcher itself.
While a legacy daemon flag is active the daemon owns the watcher and its default cadence applies; on Pi the away-posture record alone leaves the ordinary Relay watcher cadence active, and daemon-backed Relay cadence remains a deferred follow-up.
When the token is removed or empty, the next locked session-start bootstrap step removes those artifacts.
Steady-state off is silent and writes nothing.
Relay remains additive to non-Relay lifecycle behavior: homes without the generated artifacts keep the default watcher cadence and do not run the Relay poll.
Its request handling remains in Relay-specific `bin/` scripts and the `fmx-respond` skill, while the watcher owns authenticated dispatch from the generated local identity shim.

`bin/fm-x-poll.sh` calls `GET /connector/poll` with `Authorization: Bearer <FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN>`.
HTTP 204 is silent.
A newly offered pending mention with non-empty `text` is stored at `state/x-inbox/<request_id>.json` and wakes firstmate exactly once with `x-mention <request_id>`.
The poll atomically claims `state/x-context/<request_id>.offered.json` before emitting that wake, and subsequent offers of the same request stay silent even after the inbox is drained following an answer or dismiss.
Offer markers share the context registry's bounded seven-day retention, so losing or expiring the local marker lets a relay offer wake firstmate again.
The full relay object is preserved, including `in_reply_to: {author_handle, text}` when the mention is a reply in a conversation or `null` for fresh mentions.
The preserved object may also carry `in_reply_to_chain`, an optional oldest-first transcript of the surrounding conversation: entries shaped `{author_handle, text, unavailable, images, attachments}` plus an optional `kind` of `reply` (a reply ancestor), `thread_starter` (the message a thread grew from), or `history` (a recent nearby message), where an absent `kind` means a legacy reply-ancestor or thread-starter entry.
The chain is untrusted third-party public input and is often absent today (the relay currently sends it only for Discord reply chains and thread starters), so consumers treat it as strictly optional, tolerate unknown or missing fields, and read an entry with `unavailable: true` as a gap rather than content; the `fmx-respond` skill owns how firstmate reads it for referent resolution.
The mention and its chain entries may also carry attached media as image or file URLs, in fields such as `images` and `attachments`, either as bare URL strings or as objects with a `url`; a mention whose own media is empty can still have screenshots on its `thread_starter` entry.
The poll preserves those URLs in the stashed object and never downloads them, so nothing is fetched on the polling path: the responding agent retrieves and views the media with its own tools when it handles the mention.
The `fmx-respond` skill owns which hosts that fetch is restricted to and the untrusted-content handling that applies to whatever comes back.
At the same time the poll records a durable per-request reply context at `state/x-context/<request_id>.json` (`{request_id, platform, reply_max_chars, recorded_at}`) from the same authoritative relay payload, best-effort and keyed by `request_id` so concurrent requests never overwrite each other; it survives the inbox cleanup that follows the acknowledgement, so a delayed follow-up can recover the original platform and split budget even with no task link.
`recorded_at` begins as the locally observed first-seen Unix epoch and remains unchanged when the same request is polled again.
A successful live initial answer refreshes it to the time that the relay establishes the follow-up binding; dry-runs, failed answers, and follow-ups do not refresh it.
Configured polls prune records beyond the local follow-up window, capped at the relay's seven-day window; legacy or malformed records fall back to their file modification time so they cannot remain indefinitely.
The record is written only when a platform or explicit budget is actually known, so an unknown-platform mention leaves no useless entry.
The `fmx-respond` skill decides whether the stashed mention is an actionable request, a question, or a pure acknowledgment.
Actionable reversible requests are run through intake, backlog, dispatch, investigation, or ship flow as appropriate.
If the work completes in that turn, the public reply reports the outcome.
If the request spawns a longer-running task, firstmate posts an acknowledgement through the normal answer endpoint, links the task to the mention with `bin/fm-x-link.sh`, and posts up to three completion follow-ups on genuine milestones, finishing with a `--final` one for ordinary Relay-linked work. When a typed promised-final commitment is registered, `bin/fm-public-followup.sh` owns the terminal reply and clears the legacy link after its receipt is validated.
That link stores optional reply-platform context so Discord-originated follow-ups keep Discord's larger message budget after the inbox file has been drained.
Platform/budget resolution is layered and independent of the task link: a per-axis `FMX_REPLY_PLATFORM` / `FMX_REPLY_MAX_CHARS` override (how `bin/fm-x-followup.sh` passes a recorded link's context) wins.
For either axis without an override, `bin/fm-x-lib.sh:fmx_resolve_reply_context` owns the source order: the durable per-request registry is consulted first, then the still-present inbox payload, then - for a follow-up posted live by request_id - an authoritative relay lookup via `POST /connector/request-context` (`{request_id}` in, `{platform, reply_max_chars}` back).
This is what keeps a delayed request-id follow-up on the original platform's budget even after the inbox is drained and with no task link surviving; the relay step is confined to the live follow-up path so the answer path and every dry-run stay network-free.
The link is home-local by construction, because it lives in that home's own `state/<task-id>.meta`: work routed to a secondmate has no record here, so `bin/fm-x-link.sh` refuses it, names the registered secondmate home the task was found in when it can, and points at the promised-final path (`bin/fm-public-followup.sh register ... --work-home secondmate:<id>`), which is the only follow-up mechanism that binds work in another home.
`bin/fm-x-link.sh` follows the same ordering when recording a fresh link's context and requires `jq`; its request-context lookup is best-effort: no token or `curl`; a non-2xx response; an unresolved response; or a relay version without that endpoint leaves the context unknown.
In that case the link is still recorded but `bin/fm-x-link.sh` prints a loud warning; and when either a follow-up's platform or explicit budget cannot be authoritatively resolved from any source, `bin/fm-x-reply.sh` refuses it (fail-safe exit 8) rather than posting with a local default - firstmate holds and retries it once both values are recoverable.
Fresh links start with `x_followups=0` and the current timestamp; when relinking the same relay request onto a successor task, pass paired `--carry-count <n> --carry-ts <epoch>` flags plus any prior `x_platform=` and `x_reply_max_chars=` as `--carry-platform <x|discord> --carry-max <n>` so the successor preserves the already-consumed follow-up count, original 7-day window, and reply split budget.
Pure acknowledgments or mentions with nothing to answer are dismissed through `bin/fm-x-dismiss.sh` before the local inbox file is cleared.
Dismiss sends `POST /connector/dismiss` with `{request_id}`, posts no text, and tells the relay to drop the request instead of re-offering it or falling back to an offline auto-reply; on success it clears that request's durable reply-context record, while the separate offer marker remains for its bounded retention so a brief relay re-offer stays silent.
Relay auth or config problems are reported once as `x-mode-error ...` until recovery.
A failed durable offer claim is likewise reported once as `x-mode-error cannot record mention offer` and remains deduplicated through quiet no-pending polls until a later offer confirms an existing valid marker or claims a new one.
Live replies are posted by `bin/fm-x-reply.sh`, which sends `POST /connector/answer` with `{request_id,text}` for one-message replies.
Add `--image <path>` to attach one local PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP, or TIFF as `{media_type,data_base64}` in the relay's optional `image` object.
Completion follow-ups use `bin/fm-x-followup.sh`, which checks the local `state/<id>.meta` link and sends the same payload shape through `POST /connector/followup` by calling `bin/fm-x-reply.sh --followup`, up to three times per link within the window.
Add `--image <path>` there too when a completion follow-up should carry an image.
A successful post increments the local `x_followups=` counter and keeps the link, unless `--final` was passed or the new count reaches the cap, in which case the link is cleared instead; a failed post leaves the link and counter untouched so it can be retried.
The relay itself rejects a follow-up past its own cap or window with HTTP 409 and may include `{"error":"followup_unavailable"}` in the response body; the client surfaces any follow-up 409 as a distinguishable exit code and uses the body marker only for a sharper diagnostic.
`fm-x-followup.sh` treats that exit exactly like a locally-detected expiry - clearing the link and skipping quietly rather than retrying - so an older single-follow-up relay or an already-exhausted binding degrades gracefully.
It treats `fm-x-reply.sh`'s fail-safe refusal (exit 8: platform or explicit budget unresolved) differently: that is a retryable hold, so the link is KEPT and the follow-up is retried once both values can be recovered, never posted with a local default.
Past-window relay rejections are only guaranteed while the expired binding row still exists on the relay side; after its cleanup sweep, a very-late follow-up call may instead see a benign no-op 200, which is why the local window and cap pruning remains the primary guard.
Reply splitting is platform-aware: an explicit relay platform field (`reply_platform`, `platform`, `target_platform`, `source_platform`, or `provider`) wins, otherwise a legacy `tweet_id` beginning with `discord:` selects Discord and a numeric `tweet_id` selects X.
An explicit relay limit field (`reply_max_chars`, `reply_max_characters`, `message_max_chars`, `message_limit`, or `max_chars`) wins over the platform defaults.
If the reply exceeds the selected budget, the client splits it into a numbered thread on fenced-code, paragraph, line, and word boundaries and sends `{request_id,text,texts}`, where `texts` is the ordered chunk list and `text` remains the first chunk for older relays.
When `--image <path>` is present on a split reply, the image rides the first/opener message and later chunks stay text-only.
`FMX_X_REPLY_MAX_CHARS` defaults to 280 and clamps to a minimum of 50; `FMX_DISCORD_REPLY_MAX_CHARS` defaults to 1900, clamps to a minimum of 50, and resets values above Discord's 2000-character limit back to 1900.
`FMX_X_THREAD_MAX` defaults to 25 and caps oversized reply threads for every platform, marking the last retained message with an ellipsis when truncation is needed.
`FMX_FOLLOWUP_MAX_AGE_SECS` defaults to 604800 (7 days) and controls the local completion follow-up window; `FMX_FOLLOWUP_MAX_COUNT` defaults to 3 and controls the local follow-up cap.

Set `FMX_DRY_RUN` to preview replies and dismissals without posting.
Truthy means anything except unset, empty, `0`, `false`, `no`, or `off`; an explicit environment value wins over `.env`.
In dry-run, `fm-x-reply.sh` records the would-be payload to `state/x-outbox/<request_id>.json`, including `texts` for a thread and an `endpoint` marker for follow-up previews, prints a `DRY RUN` summary to stderr, echoes the `request_id`, and exits 0.
When an image is attached, the dry-run record uses compact `{media_type, bytes, source_path}` metadata instead of writing the base64 bytes.
In dry-run, `fm-x-dismiss.sh` records `{request_id, endpoint:"dismiss"}` to the same outbox path, prints a `DRY RUN` summary, echoes the `request_id`, and exits 0.
The live answer and follow-up bodies intentionally stay the same shape, including optional `image`; the relay distinguishes them by endpoint, and dismiss stays `{request_id}`.
These paths need `jq` to build the JSON payload, but they run before token and network checks, so they need neither `FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN` nor `curl`.

### Promised public replies (state/public-followup)

A relay request that spawns real work can leave firstmate owing a specific public reply in a specific thread.
That promise is a typed `kind=public-followup` obligation whose state machine is owned entirely by `tasks-axi public-followup`, while the full private conversation context stays only in `state/x-context/`.
Firstmate's bounded registration retains the obligation's public-safe request binding so a delivered loop can be rechained without the original inbox.
`bin/fm-public-followup.sh` is firstmate's side: it registers a commitment, reconciles typed terminal work results into it, posts the final reply through `bin/fm-x-reply.sh --followup`, and explicitly rechains or retires the retained loop.
Run `bin/fm-public-followup.sh --help` for the exact subcommands and flags.

Registration is what creates this home's private transport under `state/public-followup/` (mode 0700): `registry/` for the bounded private binding of each open public loop (the record survives delivery, stamped `state=delivered`, and is removed only by `retire`), `events/` for typed terminal results awaiting reconciliation, `consumed/` for the accepted-event ledger, `rejected/` for refusals kept with a one-line reason, `rejection-wakes/` for each refusal's not-yet-raised wake, `retired/` for the mode-0600 reason-and-time receipt written before removal, and `surfaced` for the poll's last-surfaced signature.
A work home that reports across a machine boundary also gets `outbox/`, described below.
The home that owns the commitment also owns the outward post, because only it holds the relay consent, the request context, and the opaque thread binding.
Work routed elsewhere reports a typed terminal result with `bin/fm-public-followup-emit.sh` and never looks for the thread; when writing directly into the owning home, that emitter refuses a home with no registration for the named obligation.
`bin/fm-public-followup.sh brief` pre-fills every deliverable value the binding determines, such as `report_path=data/<work-id>/report.md`, and states the accepted format of every value it cannot know.
The emitter validates deliverable values and known required keys before publishing, including the relative `report_path` format, and names correctable mistakes at the work home.
A direct emit reads the obligation from `tasks-axi`; a staged emit cannot read that remote record, so `brief` supplies its required keys in the printed command.
If those flags are omitted from a staged command, it still checks values but cannot detect missing keys until the owning home's `consume` rejects the event and queues a rejection wake.
The [emitter header](../bin/fm-public-followup-emit.sh) and its `--help` own the exact flags and outcome-dependent validation rules.
When that work lives in a REMOTE secondmate home, delivery clears its bound legacy link after validating the public receipt, while retirement clears the link before closing the loop, and both clears run over that route's SSH transport.
Readable remote state that proves no link exists succeeds without a write, while a present link is cleared only when its Relay request identity matches the registration and the state is writable; an identity mismatch, unreadable or unsafe state, an unavailable write or lock, an older remote copy, or a host that never confirms the clear leaves the loop retained for reconciliation.
A terminal event's id is derived from its identity tuple, so a duplicate report, a retry, or a replay after restart resolves to the same event and changes nothing.
When bound work ends failed or parked, its typed failed result remains deliverable even when the promised final expected a merged pull request, so the owed reply carries the honest failure instead of remaining stranded.

Work bound to a REMOTE secondmate home reports across a machine boundary, where no local path reaches the owning home.
`bin/fm-public-followup.sh brief` therefore prints that worker the route's own code root and home with `--stage-in`, so the typed result is staged in `outbox/` in the home where the work actually runs rather than written to a path that only exists on the owning machine.
The owning home collects staged results for open registrations over the same SSH route it reaches that secondmate on, because that transport only runs in the outbound direction: `consume` pulls them into its own `events/` and then reconciles them exactly as it reconciles a local report.
Non-open registrations owe no result, so `consume` skips them without contacting their routes; an open registration whose reachable route has nothing staged remains pending without an error.
Collection is non-destructive until the result is durably held, and the staged copy is retired only afterwards, so a dropped connection can never lose a terminal result.
For an open registration, a work home that cannot be reached is named in `consume`'s output and keeps the promise open; it is never reported as an empty inbox.
Run `bin/fm-public-followup-collect.sh --help` for the staged-result commands the owning home runs over that route.

Activation is the same `.env` `FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN` contract as the rest of Relay, with no second flag.
A home without that token runs one file test and stops: no `tasks-axi` call, no backlog or request-context scan, and no `state/public-followup/` directory.
Ordinary startup, polling, cleanup, and silent read-side subcommands also produce no output; commands that require an active relay report that configuration error after the same gate.
A relay-enabled home with no registered commitment stops at an O(1) directory presence check, so the empty state costs no CLI call and adds no periodic scan.
Unreconciled terminal results ride the existing 30-second relay poll rather than a new process or timer: `bin/fm-x-poll.sh` compares the pending-event signature against `surfaced` and wakes firstmate once per new result set.
A terminal event `tasks-axi` refuses during `consume` is quarantined with a reason naming the specific deliverable, outcome, or missing key where one is identifiable, and the same poll wakes the owning home with a `public-followup rejected <event-id> ...` line carrying that reason.
The refused event stays pending until that wake is recorded, and a queued wake survives a failed read or write to poll output.
That makes the wake at-least-once rather than exactly-once: a cleanup that fails after the line was already raised - a wake directory that cannot be written, or a refused event that could not be drained - raises the same refusal again on a later poll.
A repeat carries the same event id and the same reason as the quarantined rejection, which is how an already-handled refusal is recognized.
Acknowledge it without re-acting; re-emitting an already accepted corrected result is harmless but redundant because its derived event id is already in the accepted ledger.
The session-start digest separately prints a "Public commitments" subsection from disk when, and only when, this home is relay-active and still holds an open public loop (a reply still owed, or a delivered loop with nothing owed), so compaction and restart are non-events.
`bin/fm-teardown.sh` refuses to clean up a task while this home still owes a public reply for exactly that work, unless `--force` carries explicit discard approval.
`FM_PF_RETRY_BACKOFF_SECS` (default 900) sets the next-attempt time recorded with a retryable delivery error.
See [verification/public-followup.md](verification/public-followup.md) for the current maintainer evidence behind restart recovery, failed terminal outcomes, retained-loop disposition, and the relay-disabled zero-overhead guarantee.

## Trusted external process-event adapters (config/extensions.d)

A home can explicitly enable a trusted external `process-event-adapter/1` package without adding package code to Firstmate.
This is one narrow extension type, not a general plugin or hook system.
[`extension-bindings.md`](extension-bindings.md) owns the manifest, binding, trust, handshake, invocation-envelope, capability, version-compatibility, and authority-boundary contracts.
`bin/fm-extension.sh --help` and `bin/fm-procevent.sh --help` own exact command mechanics.

Discovery reads only mode-`0600` bindings under this home's mode-`0700` `config/extensions.d/` directory.
The current directory, projects, task copies, worker text, environment payloads, and Pi packages are never searched for extensions.
When the directory is absent, ordinary process-event commands perform only a bounded absence check, create no package or extension state, and preserve every built-in adapter path.

Binding separates the package's own manifest from this home's explicit enablement.
`bind` validates the source package, computes every digest, copies the complete tree into the read-only content-addressed `data/extensions/packages/` store, performs the live handshake, and atomically publishes the enabled adapter-name subset.
The operator supplies trust and required consent facts, not hashes.
`state/extensions/<extension-id>/` is created when binding performs its initial handshake and is that package's home-local working namespace for later verification and invocation.
`state/extension-invocations/` contains private host-owned exact process-group cleanup records only while an enabled package invocation is starting or running; retirement and reconciliation retain their existing owners until those records prove the group extinct.
This integrity boundary does not sandbox trusted same-user code, so bind only a package trusted to run with the operator's operating-system access.

The shipped `file-signal` package is a complete neutral example.
Copy it to a persistent directory outside every Git project or task copy, then bind and verify it:

```sh
mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/share/firstmate-packages"
cp -R docs/examples/process-event-extension \
  "$HOME/.local/share/firstmate-packages/file-signal"
bin/fm-extension.sh bind \
  "$HOME/.local/share/firstmate-packages/file-signal" \
  --adapter file-signal \
  --trust-same-user-code \
  --consent artifact-references
bin/fm-extension.sh list
bin/fm-extension.sh inspect org.firstmate.example.file-signal
bin/fm-extension.sh verify org.firstmate.example.file-signal
```

Use an absent destination for the copy so the source identity remains inspectable and reproducible.
For a non-default home, set `FM_HOME=<that-home>` on every command; local and remote secondmate homes bind the package independently, and bindings are not inherited.
For a configured remote secondmate, keep the package at the controller and transfer it through the authenticated `fm-on` route:

```sh
bin/fm-extension.sh remote-bind <secondmate-id> \
  /absolute/controller/path/to/file-signal \
  --adapter file-signal \
  --trust-same-user-code \
  --consent artifact-references
```

The command serializes only the validated extension package, stages it below the addressed remote home's fixed extension staging root, binds it there, and prints transfer and binding digests.
Registration uses `bin/fm-on.sh <secondmate-id> fm-procevent.sh ...`.
After retiring every registration with its printed owner token and handling every captured result, retire the enabled remote binding and its exact staged transfer together with `bin/fm-on.sh <secondmate-id> fm-extension.sh retire-transfer <extension-id> --if-transfer-digest <transfer-digest> --if-binding-digest <binding-digest>`.
For a direct local binding, use `bin/fm-extension.sh retire-binding <extension-id> --if-binding-digest <binding-digest>` after the same process-event retirement and handling steps.
Both commands retain the retired identity reversibly and leave unrelated bindings and content-addressed installed packages unchanged.

Register one file completion source with a path-safe source id and an explicit non-secret source configuration reference.
Credential values never belong in that reference, command argv, or a process-event result:

```sh
bin/fm-procevent.sh register-extension file-signal build-complete \
  --config-ref "file:/absolute/path/to/build-result.txt"
bin/fm-procevent.sh reconcile
```

`register-extension` prints the new registration's owner token and exact owner-matched retirement command.
The source waits outside the conversational turn, and its completed result arrives through the existing process-event `check` path.
Classify the captured result through its immutable package identity with `bin/fm-procevent.sh classify <result-file>`, acknowledge it with the existing `handled` command only after it is handled, and use the printed `retire --if-owner` command when explicit retirement is needed.
Never run the registered blocking source command directly in a conversational turn.

## Process-to-event sources (state/procevent)

A long-polling external process is registered as a *source* through its adapter, whose header and `--help` own the commands and flags.
`bin/fm-procevent.sh` owns the generic contract; built-in adapters retain their tracked `bin/fm-procevent-<adapter>.sh` commands, while an explicitly bound external adapter routes through the trusted host contract above.
`bin/fm-procevent-lavish.sh` is the first built-in adapter and wraps only the currently published `lavish-axi poll` interface.
Before arming any Lavish source, open its artifact with `lavish-axi` so the saved session identifies the board's server; each poll attempt derives its host and port from that session and refuses missing or invalid session evidence before consuming a staged worker reply.
That adapter, and only that adapter, retries the one exact transient response a cut-short listener returns while its marks remain available (`error: Lavish Editor poll response was interrupted` with `code: SERVER_ERROR`), up to 12 times with poll starts at least 5 seconds apart, so an internal retry never reaches the runner as a captured result.
This start-to-start governor is a no-op after a normally blocking poll but caps an immediately returning poll under the shipped defaults independently of the owner lease and registration launch pacing.
Real feedback, ended and missing sessions, any other `SERVER_ERROR`, and that same interruption still standing once the bound is spent are all captured and announced normally; `FM_LAVISH_POLL_RETRY_DELAY` is a bounded 1 to 60 second test override for the interval only, and the runner itself stays adapter-agnostic.
An already-armed Lavish source keeps its registered listener command until it is retired and armed again, so retire the source, then arm it again to adopt this retry policy.

### Crew-hosted Lavish review boards

A live task that hosts a Lavish board owns its listener, so firstmate must never arm that board.
After opening the artifact as required above, the worker arms it with `bin/fm-procevent-lavish.sh arm <artifact.html> --for <task-id>` and never runs `lavish-axi poll` itself.
`arm` prints `armed` only after the process-event owner confirms this registration generation's listener is running, and otherwise returns nonzero without that line.
The confirmation is the same live claim or launch-stamp evidence `reconcile` already uses, bounded by `FM_PROCEVENT_LAUNCH_CONFIRM_SECONDS`, and a failed confirmation retires a source that never started unless `retire` refuses because something may still own it, in which case the registration stays for `reconcile` or a human.
An earlier registration's listener that releases the board inside the confirm window lets the new registration start, and `arm` then reports `armed` as usual.
When a live listener from an earlier registration of the same board still holds it when the window ends, `arm` exits zero with `still-listening` instead of `armed`, because that earlier listener keeps serving the board and the new registration takes effect only after the source is retired and armed again.
The arm is refused unless that task id has valid, identity-matching endpoint metadata, because a board whose owner has no endpoint would collect feedback nobody can be told about.
The registration persists as one task-owned source record, while each captured nonterminal round remains open until the worker re-arms and the existing handled marker acknowledges that round.
Re-arm is that acknowledgement and nothing else: the board is armed once while no record exists, and a further arm by the same owner is refused unless an unacknowledged nonterminal round is waiting, so a generation already carrying a reply is never replaced before its listener posts it.
Re-arm never acquires, releases, or hands off the source claim, and it may carry `--agent-reply-file <path>` whose contents are copied into that generation's own private staging file and handed once to the published `--agent-reply` argument; a re-arm that fails leaves the prior registration and the reply it references exactly as they were, including when the acknowledgement it owes cannot be recorded.
Posting that reply is best effort by design: the listener consumes the staged file only once its own setup and the board artifact have checked out, so the one loss window is a rare crash between that consume and the call it feeds, which drops that round's reply rather than posting it twice, and nothing here keeps a receipt, retry, or idempotency record - robust reply delivery waits on lavish-axi's exclusive listener.
The captured result is stored with immutable task-owner routing evidence and delivered directly to that task's steering inbox, without a firstmate `check` wake for the captain's words.
Filing that steering note away is not acknowledging the round, so while the round stays open every reconcile puts a live note back in the owner's inbox rather than ringing a filed one.
A task-owned source with an unhandled capture is not relaunched, so delivery failure cannot consume a round and start another poll.
That record is the only ownership evidence there is, so while any captured round of it is unacknowledged every retirement path refuses - the runner's own terminal retirement and an explicit `retire` alike - and the refusal names the acknowledgement that releases it.
A terminal result, including `session_ended`, an empty End, or missing, is delivered to the owner with an explicit stop-and-conclude instruction and is never auto-rearmed.
That round keeps the board with its owner: the source record is not retired while the terminal capture is unacknowledged, so no second armer can take the board, and acknowledging it with `bin/fm-procevent.sh handled <source-id> <sequence>` is what concludes and retires it.
That conclude retains the registration it is retiring, removes it, then records the acknowledgement and restores the registration if that record cannot be written, so a failed conclude never leaves the round open with its owner gone.
An interruption between those two durable steps leaves the board unregistered with its terminal round still open, which nothing relaunches and the same `handled` call finishes.
It concludes only a round that is still open, so a repeated acknowledgement of an already-closed round reports `already-handled` and never touches whatever registration holds the board by then.
A second armer is refused with the current owner named, and the source list derives `listening`, `round-open`, or `dead` from the claim and handled captures without a second ownership record.
If the hosting worker cannot be recovered, relaunch a worker to re-host first; guarded firstmate adoption is an explicit last resort only after the old claim is proved dead.
The cross-home gap between worker rounds remains an accepted residual until lavish-axi's exclusive listener lands.
The interim crew instruction emitted by `bin/fm-brief.sh` points workers at this arm-and-acknowledge contract.

The `when` adapter (`bin/fm-procevent-when.sh`) turns this channel into a condition->action primitive: it registers a deterministic condition and a deterministic action once, its blocking child polls the condition without waking firstmate, and a stable true fires the action at most once before one terminal outcome is durably captured and published as a wake that remains eligible for re-announcement until handled.
The (condition, action) spec is stored privately under `state/when/` and hash-bound by a trust record the same way `bin/fm-check-register.sh` binds a custom check, while the spec separately binds the resolved action executable's bytes; a mutated or unregistered spec or a changed action executable is refused before the action runs, and that binding is reloaded from disk immediately before each fire rather than trusted from when polling started.
A repo update that fast-forwards an in-repo action's bytes in place would otherwise desync every already-armed watch's trust binding with no tampering involved; `bin/fm-procevent-when.sh rebind-all` re-hashes and republishes the binding for every registered watch whose action lives under `FM_ROOT`, including one already polling, so it keeps firing across such an update instead of being refused on its next fire.
Every failure path - a mutated spec or action executable, a condition error past its budget, an expired deadline, a failed action, or an earlier fire whose outcome was never captured - produces a terminal captured outcome that wakes firstmate rather than a silent retry, and a durable single-fire marker claimed before the action makes restarts and re-polls unable to fire it twice.
The adapter automates only the exact deterministic subset: anything needing judgment, and anything destructive, irreversible, or security-sensitive, keeps the ordinary check-fires-then-firstmate-decides flow, and the adapter's header and `--help` own its commands, flags, and outcome document.

This section is the single owner of the runner's operating contract.
Process-event commands resolve the state root to its physical directory before validating it and deriving paths, so a home reached through a symlinked ancestor behaves like its physical spelling while an unsafe target directory remains refused.
Registration writes one private record under `state/procevent/`, and a completed result plus its immutable adapter identity are captured under `state/procevent-inbox/` before any announcement or event can reference it.
By default, results are published as ordinary `check` wakes carrying the source id and committed result sequence through the existing durable wake queue, so the runner adds no second notification control plane.
The self-announcing adapter exception and its fail-safe ordering are defined below.
The watcher delivers a queued result on its ordinary cycle by reporting it as an actionable `check` wake, so a default or fallback publication reaches firstmate through the same rewake path every other wake uses and never waits for a manual drain.
A queued `check` delivery is reported at most once per captured source and sequence while any records for that key remain queued.
A durable handled acknowledgement stops future source re-announcement, while a record already queued remains under the durable queue's authority until the ordinary drain's sequence-bound post-handling acknowledgement consumes it.

Discovery is never a timer.
Each registered source has its own child process blocking on that source, and the watcher's per-cycle `reconcile` republishes every captured result with no durable handled acknowledgement yet - regardless of any earlier publication - restarts a source whose owner is gone, and stops this home's runner when reconciliation runs after its registration disappeared unexpectedly.
In supported steady state, a home with no registered source runs nothing, generates no state, and keeps its ordinary cadence.

Whether a captured result is a routine no-op is adapter knowledge too, and the runner names no adapter-specific condition for it either.
Before publishing, the runner asks the immutable captured owner through the built-in `silent` command or external `result.silent` operation and treats exit 0 as the only silence verdict: the result is recorded as durably handled and never announced, so it neither wakes a handler now nor returns on a later reconcile.
The task-owned terminal exception is evaluated first, so an empty terminal board round goes to its owner's steering inbox for the required conclusion instead of entering this generic silence path.
A missing command, an error, any other exit, or a silence the runner cannot durably record all publish the `check` wake exactly as before, so an adapter with no notion of a no-op needs no change and an unknown or degraded result always reaches its handler.
For built-ins, silence remains independent of the keyed-answer feed below: suppressing an announcement never suppresses the captain's own answer.
For Lavish that verdict covers two shapes - a session the adapter classifies `ended` that carries no queued content block at all, which is a review surface closed with nothing said, and `browser_disconnected` (classified `disconnected`), which carries no answer while the session remains open.
Any recognized top-level `prompts` or `feedback` block counts as content regardless of its declared count, and a malformed header makes the result indeterminate rather than empty.
A `Send & End` close carrying the captain's answer arrives as `status: feedback` with `session_ended`, so it classifies `feedback` and is announced unchanged, as is any `ended` result that still carries content, and every `waiting`, `missing`, `unknown`, or unreadable result.

Whether a captured result ends its source is adapter knowledge, never the runner's.
After capture - and after initial `check` publication for the default ordering - the runner asks the immutable captured owner through the built-in `terminal` command or external `result.terminal` operation and retires the registration on exit 0 alone - except a task-owned board, whose terminal retirement is refused until its owner acknowledges the round, as the crew-hosted section above defines - dropping only the exact registration generation captured by its claim and releasing that claim only after removal succeeds under one source boundary; a missing command, an error, or any other exit keeps the source armed, so an adapter with no notion of ending needs no change.
A failed terminal removal stays durably terminal and is completed by ordinary reconciliation without restarting its poll, while a concurrently replaced registration survives and becomes independently runnable after the old claim releases.
Any registration refuses to replace an external registration while its prior runner claim is live, uncertain, orphaned, or terminal-pending; replacement becomes eligible only after that generation is proved gone or its terminal retirement completes.
A source that has ended therefore captures at most one terminal result, is never restarted, and leaves no recurring poll work.
For ordinary sources, explicit `retire` stays the supported and idempotent path afterwards; a task-owned board instead refuses `retire` until its owner concludes the open terminal round with `handled`.
For Lavish that verdict covers an ended session, a missing session, and the final feedback of a `Send & End` review, which the published poll marks with `session_ended` before it returns only empty ended sessions.

Applying a captured result through code is a built-in adapter seam, and some built-in results carry no judgement at all: they must simply be applied idempotently to this home's own durable state.
Leaving that to a handler means it can silently not happen, so immediately after the terminal check above the runner calls `bin/fm-procevent-<adapter>.sh autohandle <source-id> <sequence> <result-file>` and lets the built-in adapter apply and acknowledge its own result.
That call runs strictly after terminal retirement, because a handling adapter re-arms its own next source and retiring afterwards would drop that fresh registration and leave the source silently dead.
Exit 0 means the adapter fully applied and acknowledged the result; a missing command, an error, or any other exit is not a capture failure but leaves the result unacknowledged and therefore still eligible for re-announcement, so a handler receives it exactly as before and an adapter with no such command needs no change.
Announcement ordering is adapter-declared through `bin/fm-procevent-<adapter>.sh self-announcing`: an adapter that answers exit 0 declares that every result its autohandle fully applies is announced through a durable downstream channel of its own, so the runner applies first and publishes a `check` wake only for what remains unhandled afterwards; every other adapter keeps the strict publish-before-apply order, and its autohandle runs only when this capture's own wake was successfully appended to the durable queue.
The remote-secondmate reply adapter declares itself self-announcing: a captured reply reaches its local status mirror and settles its correlated pending-reply expectation without any handler step, the mirrored status bytes are the single wake for one remote note through the same signal classification a local secondmate's append gets, and only a capture the adapter could not fully apply is published as a `check` wake, whose adapter handling remains idempotent.
The [remote-secondmate channel contract](remote-secondmates.md#normal-operation) owns replay suppression and its bounded upgrade exception; a replay that adds no mirror bytes stays quiet.

Keyed captain answers from built-in adapters use one more seam of the same kind, and the runner still decides nothing about them.
Some built-in sources carry the captain's answer to a captain-held task, and what such an answer means is owned once by `bin/fm-captain-hold.sh`'s keyed-answer intake rather than by any channel.
A built-in source bound with `bin/fm-captain-hold.sh bind` therefore has each captured result passed to `bin/fm-procevent-<adapter>.sh answers <result-file>`, and whatever that prints is piped straight into that intake.
A binding can select one decision origin or the script's cross-origin mode; the command header owns the exact forms and key interpretation.
The built-in adapter reports only what the captain chose; the intake owns every rule about what happens next, so the runner names no adapter, parses no result, and carries no decision rule, and a future built-in answer source needs nothing here beyond an `answers` command and a binding.
The reserved Reconcile selection uses the parallel optional `reconciles` adapter command and binding-verified `reconcile-requests` intake rather than entering keyed answers; [`captain-hold-lifecycle.md`](captain-hold-lifecycle.md#reconcile-re-check-reality-never-a-blind-close) owns those semantics.
Feeding is independent of handling: it never acknowledges a result and never suppresses a wake, because recording the answer or request is transcription while acting on it is firstmate's judgement.
An unbound built-in source, a built-in adapter without the corresponding command, and a failure on either side all leave the capture untouched and still announced.
External binding responses never enter either authority-bearing intake.

Ownership is machine-wide per canonical source, because separate homes can share one underlying source store.
Claims live under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/firstmate/procevent-claims` (override with `FM_PROCEVENT_CLAIM_ROOT`).
Each claim binds its caller-reported home and runner PID to a process identity, unique claim generation, exact registration-file generation, and resolved state-root identity.
Registration, acquisition, replacement, retirement, and generation-bound release are serialized at one machine-wide boundary per source.
A live identity-matched owner is never displaced, and release removes only the exact generation the caller acquired.
Every stop proves ownership before its first signal: the live runner's recorded process identity must match and it must still lead its process group.
Once that stop has proved ownership and sent TERM, its own escalation to KILL checks only whether the proved group still has members; it does not re-read the leader's identity or group membership, which can change or become unreadable as TERM ends the leader.
This proof belongs only to that stop's own escalation and cannot authorize another caller that encounters an unproved group.
A stale claim whose process group still has members is one `reconcile` never displaces, and the two shapes it comes in recover differently.
`reconcile` preserves such a claim without signalling the ambiguous group or starting a replacement: the group check probes the runner's own process group, which contains its polling source child, so surviving members can mean that child is still attached to the session the source collects from, and a replacement would put a second destructive poller on it.
`list` reports both shapes as `orphaned`.
When the recorded pid is alive under a different identity while the group still has members, the claim boundary itself does not consult the process group, so `bin/fm-procevent.sh start <source-id>` reclaims that claim provided the dead generation's reservation records can still be tidied, and otherwise refuses with `cannot claim source`; that tidy-up is waived only for a generation proven gone, which this one is not.
That hand-run command is the recovery path, taken by someone who has checked that nothing is still polling the source.
That asymmetry between the automatic path and the deliberate one is the design rather than an inconsistency, and it is not a claim-level invariant: nothing below `reconcile` enforces it.
When the leader itself is gone and its group still has members - the leader died to anything other than the stop's own signal - `start` does not reclaim the claim either: it reports `already owned` and changes nothing, and `retire`, `reconcile`, `sweep-home`, and the guard all refuse the surviving group permanently, so the source stops listening.
Recovery there is a human verifying whether the dead runner's polling child is still attached to the source; once that process group is empty the generation reads as gone and the next `reconcile` reclaims the source on its own.
Nothing automatic signals that group, and whether it may ever be signalled remains an open decision; the repaired guard does not close this gap.
Neither shape stops listening quietly: the first `reconcile` that strands a claim generation publishes a durable `check` wake naming the source and what clears it - the `start` command for the reused pid, the check to make for the leaderless group - and later cycles stay silent for that same generation while a genuinely new stranded claim announces again.
Reclaiming a generation that IS gone is not gated on tidying anything that generation left behind: its capture-reservation records, its staging file, or the registry directory a claim recorded for them.
Every one of those is keyed by claim token and every replacement claims a fresh one, so a leftover that can no longer be located or removed - a state-root identity a claim recorded before its home was re-created, or a recorded registry directory that no longer resolves to a directory - is stale bytes rather than an ownership hazard.
Making any of them a precondition is what leaves a provably dead runner owning its source permanently, because none of those conditions clears on its own.
Ordinary release and reclamation still attempt reservation cleanup and require it unless both owner staleness and whole-group absence prove the generation gone.
The narrow live-owner terminal-self-retirement path also attempts cleanup but tolerates its own still-in-flight reservation, which the runner removes on the normal end-of-capture path; exact home, PID, and claim-token ownership remains mandatory before the claim is released.
If identity cannot be established before the first signal, or a surviving owned group cannot be proved stopped, the operation preserves the registration and claim for safe retry rather than adding a second owner.
A live PID whose identity no longer matches is refused before the first signal.
Identity and process-group verification cannot be made atomic with signalling in portable shell: the reaper signals only a target it has verified as the recorded generation, but PID and group reuse remain possible in the narrow interval between verification and the signal.
Launch pacing is the primary host-wedge protection; watchdog cleanup is a backstop.

Supported secondmate retirement preflights each target home's bounded `sweep-home` command before destructive teardown, snapshots its registrations outside the target, then runs the sweep at that home's final deletion or return boundary.
If deletion or return fails, teardown restores those registrations and reconciles them before returning the refusal.
If restoration or rearming also fails, teardown returns a distinct status and reports the retained registration backup path for manual recovery instead of hiding the retired waits.
The sweep retires local registrations and machine-wide claims whose recorded state-root identity matches that home's resolved state root through the same identity-checked, generation-bound retirement path, and leaves foreign-home claims untouched.
Teardown refuses with the home, lease, routing evidence, registrations, claims, and runners retained when identity is uncertain, ownership is unreadable or unreleased, or relevant state exists without a sweep-capable child script.
Raw manual deletion of a Firstmate home is unsupported because it can orphan a blocking child.
To recover, restore that home's tracked `bin/fm-procevent.sh`, run `FM_HOME=<home> <home>/bin/fm-procevent.sh sweep-home`, then rerun the supported teardown.
The owning-home lease below bounds how long such an orphan can run, but it is a backstop, not a substitute for the supported path.

A runner is bound to the HOME that owns it, not to the one session that armed it.
That granularity is deliberate: a persistent source is meant to outlive the turn and the session that armed it, so binding a runner to its arming session would stop exactly the sources this mechanism exists to keep running.
Any activity in the same home refreshes the lease, so a replacement session, another watcher, or an ordinary inspection command keeps a runner of that home alive; a runner whose SOURCE is no longer wanted in a live home is stopped by reconcile when that source is retired, independently of the lease.
The lease is therefore the backstop for a home that is GONE - the torn-down test sandbox this change exists to bound - and not a per-session ownership check.
KNOWN LIMIT: while any activity continues in a home whose original owning session has ended, that activity refreshes the lease and a runner of that home keeps running until its source is retired or the home goes away.
Detaching a runner into its own process group is what lets a persistent source outlive the turn that armed it, and on its own it is also what lets a runner outlive its whole home: reparented to init, it keeps its blocking child - and every process that child spawns - running with nothing left to reap it.
So a home's process-event state carries a lease that registration, attached start, reconciliation, acknowledgement, and listing refresh, and the watcher's reconcile cycle is what keeps it fresh in a live home.
An attached public `start` continues refreshing the lease while its caller remains attached.
Each runner fails closed unless a small guard starts successfully beside it in a separate process group.
That guard accepts the lease only while the state root retains the device/inode identity recorded by the runner's claim, and initiates the verified stop after two consecutive reads cannot prove that identity and lease freshness, so one unreadable read cannot kill a live runner.
Those two reads are spaced half a check interval apart, so the pair the debounce requires completes inside one check interval instead of costing two of them.
For a runner whose ownership can still be proved, the nominal detection bound is therefore the lease plus one check interval, after which the verified stop runs within its own grace period; the lease age is compared in whole seconds, so a configured lease is honoured until that age reads one second past it, and scheduling delays or failed inspection and signalling can extend the whole bound.
That grace is a ceiling rather than a delay every stop pays: two seconds for the ordinary signal and two more for the forced one, spent only by a group that outlives the signal it was sent, which is why a healthy runner's stop completes in a fraction of a second.
The group signal reaches the blocking child and everything under it exactly as retirement does.
A runner exports the inherited `FM_PROCEVENT_IN_RUNNER` marker and every lease refresh is skipped under it, so a runner and its ordinary children do not certify their own owner, and the next reconcile in a live home simply starts a replacement runner.
That no-self-refresh rule is CONFUSED-AGENT-GRADE, the same deliberate captain-decided grade `bin/fm-lease-lib.sh` documents: it stops the accidental case this boundary exists for, an orphaned or test-scaffolding source tree that would otherwise keep its own owner alive.
A source that DELIBERATELY strips the marker from its environment can still refresh the lease, so adversarial-grade unforgeability is explicitly out of scope here and tracked as separate follow-up design work.
Scope is the owning state root and one runner generation, never a script or process name, so a live source in another home is untouched: that home refreshes its own lease.
`FM_PROCEVENT_OWNER_LEASE_SECONDS` (default 600, range 1..86400) is how long a runner keeps going with no sign of activity in its owning home, and `FM_PROCEVENT_OWNER_CHECK_SECONDS` (default 15, range 1..3600) is the guard's detection interval: it re-reads the lease and the recorded state-root identity twice within each interval, half an interval apart, so the two reads its debounce needs fit inside one interval rather than costing two.
`FM_PROCEVENT_LAUNCH_FLOOR_SECONDS` (default 1, range 1..3600) is the minimum time between consecutive launches of one registration generation's stored command, bounding the launch rate of an immediately returning source during that lease window.
The generation's first launch is immediate, later launches share its monotonic pacing timestamp, a timestamp from before a reboot is treated as expired, and replacing the registration starts a fresh pacing generation.

`FM_PROCEVENT_LAUNCH_CONFIRM_SECONDS` (default 3, range 1..600) bounds how long `reconcile` waits for the runners it just started to prove they are running: never less than the configured value, and at most one second more, because the wait is measured on a whole-second clock.
Starting a runner is detached and its errors are not visible to the caller, so `reconcile` reports a start only after the source is observed owned or its launch-pacing stamp has advanced or appeared, and reports every unconfirmed launch as `failed=` and a non-zero exit instead.
Both signals are durable evidence a runner claimed: ownership is the only evidence a runner still blocked on its source ever shows, and the stamp - written after the claim and before the source command runs, and removed only by registration replacement - covers a runner that claimed, ran and exited between two polls.
A healthy launch therefore confirms on the first poll and the window only bounds a launch that has not yet proved itself - one that died before claiming, or one merely too slow to claim inside the window; confirmation cannot tell those apart, and a launch that proves itself on a later cycle closes its failure episode without a retraction wake.
All of a cycle's launches share one window, so a home full of sources that cannot start costs the same bounded wait as one.

Keep this window well below `FM_POLL`.
`bin/fm-watch.sh` runs `reconcile` once per supervision cycle, so a source that cannot start makes every cycle wait up to the confirm window before the rest of that cycle runs.
Raising the confirm window lengthens every supervision cycle and delays wake delivery by up to that much.

A source that can never start is reported as `failed=` with a non-zero exit on every `reconcile`, rather than counted as `started` and retried silently as though it were healthy, so a wedged source stays visible instead of presenting as armed.
That count reaches only whoever runs the command, because `bin/fm-watch.sh` discards `reconcile`'s output and exit status, so an unconfirmed launch is also announced through the wake queue: `reconcile` publishes a durable `check` wake (`procevent:<id>:launch-failed:<registration-identity>-<episode-nonce>`) once per failure episode, and later cycles stay silent for that episode until a launch of that source confirms, after which a fresh failure announces again under a fresh key, because the watcher never re-surfaces a key it has already surfaced.
The announcement changes nothing about the launch: `reconcile` keeps relaunching the source every cycle exactly as before, and nothing is retried differently, throttled, or recovered from that signal.
The wake says only what was observed for that shape - the launch did not prove it took the claim within the window - and, if it stays that way, names the source command and adapter binary the registration names as what to check and the attached `bin/fm-procevent.sh start <source-id>` as what reproduces a refusal on stderr, where the detached launch discards it; a later cycle that finds the source owned ends the episode on its own, so a runner that was merely slow to claim needs nothing from the operator.
A source stranded on a claim nothing may automatically displace is announced the same way, once per stranded claim generation, as described above.
`bin/fm-watch.sh` surfaces both under their own headlines - `process-event source stranded` and `process-event source failed to start` - rather than as a captured result.

A value this command cannot use is refused by name before anything is launched, the same way `FM_PROCEVENT_LAUNCH_FLOOR_SECONDS` and `FM_PROCEVENT_MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES` are refused, so a mistyped window can never present as a fleet of sources that cannot start.
`bin/fm-watch.sh` validates the same value when it arms and refuses to arm on an unusable one, naming the variable and the range: under a running watcher that refusal would otherwise repeat on every cycle into a discarded stdout and leave the whole home disarmed while presenting as supervised, whereas a watcher that will not arm is loud through the liveness guard.

`FM_PROCEVENT_MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES` (default 1048576) bounds a single captured result while the source runs; oversized output is drained but truncated with a stderr notice rather than staged or published whole or dropped.

The runner proves exactly one durability boundary: output that reached the runner is stored at mode `0600` before any event referencing it is published, and a captured result with no durable handled acknowledgement remains eligible for bounded re-announcement across any number of drains and restarts, not only the crash window right after capture.
`bin/fm-procevent.sh handled <source-id> <sequence>` is the only thing that stops re-announcement: a generation-keyed, private, path-safe, durable, and idempotent acknowledgement that atomically checks and deduplicates by the exact source and sequence, so a paired effect gated on its first-time-vs-repeat report is never authorized twice.
Default and fallback `check` publication is still best-effort, so the same source and sequence can repeat even before any restart; handlers deduplicate that identity rather than assuming a wake is unique.
The runner proves nothing about the source side, and the handled acknowledgement proves nothing about a paired external effect performed before it: a crash between that effect and the acknowledgement call can still repeat the effect on replay, so this is never a generic exactly-once guarantee.
The published `lavish-axi poll` clears feedback destructively before returning it, so a result lost between that clearing and the runner reading process output is unrecoverable.
Never describe this path as at-least-once, no-loss, or lossless.
`docs/verification/process-event-sources.md` holds the measurements and `.agents/skills/process-event-sources/SKILL.md` owns the handling procedure.

## Spoken interface and captain inbox (config/voice-*, config/inbox-*)

The spoken interface in [`docs/voice-relay.md`](voice-relay.md) and the model-backed subcommands of `bin/fm-inbox.sh` reach a paid API in a named account, so no region, model id or AWS profile is shipped as a tracked default.
Each is one line in a local, gitignored `config/` file, with an environment variable that overrides it for a single run, and a missing required value refuses with the path to write rather than falling back to a value that belongs to another home.
That configuration is the whole opt-in: an unconfigured home cannot start the relay and cannot run `fm-inbox.sh say` or `ask`, while `note`, `announce`, `reply`, `receipts`, `ready`, `status`, `list` and `drain` need no configuration at all because they make no model call.
The voice handover depends on `note`, so it keeps working in a home that has configured nothing.

| File | Environment | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `config/voice-region` | `FM_VOICE_REGION` | Bedrock region for the relay's bidirectional session, required by `bin/fm-voice-relay.py`. |
| `config/voice-model` | `FM_VOICE_MODEL` | Speech-to-speech model id, required by `bin/fm-voice-relay.py`. |
| `config/voice-profile` | `FM_VOICE_PROFILE` | AWS profile the relay exports credentials from; absent, or an explicitly empty variable, means it uses only credentials already in its environment. |
| `config/voice-id` | `FM_VOICE_ID` | Output voice id, optional, `matthew` when unset. |
| `config/voice-read-scope` | none | `counts` (the default, and what an absent file means) or `full`; see [`docs/voice-relay.md`](voice-relay.md) for what each scope may say. |
| `config/voice-read-deny` | none | One plain case-insensitive substring per line; a matching open item is withheld from every list and reduced to a count. |
| `config/inbox-region` | `FM_INBOX_REGION` | AWS region for `fm-inbox.sh say` and `ask`. |
| `config/inbox-stt-model` | `FM_INBOX_STT_MODEL` | Speech-to-text model id, required by `fm-inbox.sh say`. |
| `config/inbox-ask-model` | `FM_INBOX_ASK_MODEL` | Side-question model id, required by `fm-inbox.sh ask`. |
| `config/inbox-profile` | `FM_INBOX_PROFILE` | AWS profile for those two calls; absent, or an explicitly empty variable, means whatever credentials are already in the environment. |

Each account, model and voice file above is read as its first line that is not blank and not a `#` comment, so a comment above the value is fine.
The two read files are parsed differently: `config/voice-read-scope` must hold the bare word and nothing but blank space around it, so a comment header there refuses instead of being skipped, while every line of `config/voice-read-deny` that is not blank and not a `#` comment is one more substring.
`FM_VOICE_RELAY` and `FM_VOICE_PYTHON` belong to the laptop rather than to a home, so they have no config file: `bin/fm-voice-client.py` requires the relay path as a flag or that variable and carries no default path.

`fm-teardown.sh` retries only Git's `Unable to create '...index.lock': File exists` return failure up to `FM_TREEHOUSE_RETURN_LOCK_RETRIES` times.
`FM_TREEHOUSE_RETURN_LOCK_RETRIES` accepts a nonnegative integer, and an unset, blank, or invalid value uses the default of 3.
`FM_TREEHOUSE_RETURN_LOCK_RETRY_WAIT_SECS` accepts nonnegative whole or fractional seconds between attempts.
When it is unset or blank, `FM_STALE_WORKTREE_LOCK_RETRY_WAIT_SECS` remains a compatible fallback, and a blank fallback uses the 1-second default.
An invalid nonblank wait falls back to 1 second rather than interrupting teardown.
Teardown never removes a lock during the retry window, and after that window it attempts stale-lock cleanup only for a still-present lock that passes the configured age and live-holder checks.

`fm-fleet-sync.sh` applies the same shape to an orphaned `.git/packed-refs.lock`: it retries only Git's `Unable to create '...packed-refs.lock': File exists` fetch failure up to `FM_FLEET_SYNC_PACKED_REFS_LOCK_RETRIES` times (nonnegative integer; unset, blank, or invalid uses the default of 3), waiting `FM_FLEET_SYNC_PACKED_REFS_LOCK_RETRY_WAIT_SECS` seconds (nonnegative whole or fractional; invalid falls back to 1 second) before each.
Only after those retries exhaust does it remove the lock, and only when it is provably stale - still present, mtime age at least `FM_FLEET_SYNC_PACKED_REFS_LOCK_AGE_SECS` (default 30), and no `lsof` holder of the lock file or of the clone worktree itself (a live `git` keeps that as its cwd even in the window after it closes the lock and before it exits).
A live lock, a missing `lsof`, any failed check, or any other fetch failure keeps today's behavior.
Every wait, retry, and removal is printed to stderr, and a successful recovery also prints one `recovered:` summary line to stdout so a session-start refresh - which discards fleet-sync stderr and relays only stdout - still surfaces it.
The shared staleness proof lives in `bin/fm-lock-lib.sh`, which both `fm-teardown.sh` and `fm-fleet-sync.sh` use.
