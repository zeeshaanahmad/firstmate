# Watcher continuity

The watcher remains intentionally one-shot: one actionable reason closes one watcher cycle.
Must-work continuity now lives above that process boundary instead of depending on the model remembering a re-arm step.

## Ownership

Pi's `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts` and OpenCode's `.opencode/plugins/fm-primary-watch-arm.js` own continuous re-arm after an actionable child close.
Each adapter starts the next arm before delivering the wake prompt, checks current session-lock ownership at launch, preserves one child or scheduled retry at a time, and applies bounded exponential retry after an unexpected or failed close.
A failed follow-up never cancels continuity restoration.
Pi same-process session replacement follows the generation-owner contract in `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts`.
Claude's `.claude/settings.json` Stop `asyncRewake` hook (`bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh`) owns routine tokenless re-arm.
The hook fires on every Stop, and an eligible primary with supervision need admits one home-scoped owner that foregrounds `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh` inside the hook-owned process tree.
A numeric session-lock owner that fails the shared `fm_harness_pid_alive` predicate is reclaimed through `bin/fm-lock.sh` before auto-arm state changes, while a live owner, absent lock, or malformed lock keeps the competing hook inert.
The stale-owner claim occurs only after the existing AFK and supervision-need gates pass.
After each non-actionable arm close, the hook rechecks the identity-matched watcher lock and fresh beacon before retrying a bounded number of times.
A cycle-end failure is benign when that live-watcher predicate is true, and the hook suppresses the arm output and continues silently.
Only an exhausted failure with no verified watcher emits one last-resort notice for the continuous failure episode; later consecutive Stop cycles exit 2 to guarantee another Stop-owned retry without repeating the notice until the turn-end guard consumes the attended fail-open.
The Claude turn-end guard owns the monotonic failure progression, one-time attended fail-open, post-alarm continuation suppression, and positive recovery reset described in [`turnend-guard.md`](turnend-guard.md#harness-integrations).
While supervision is still needed and away mode remains inactive, an actionable close wakes the idle session through exit 2.

## Actionable wake ordering

After an actionable Pi or OpenCode child close, the adapter starts and verifies one singleton successor before it delivers the original wake.
It waits at most one readiness timeout per attempt, then sends TERM and waits a bounded retirement confirmation before the next lock-verified exponential retry.
If the unready arm does not retire within that bound, the adapter keeps ownership, starts no overlapping retry, and delivers the typed fallback immediately.
When that retained arm later closes, its actual close is classified as a new supervised event without replaying the earlier fallback.
After the configured retry bound is exhausted, it delivers the original wake with a typed continuity-restoration failure even if every successor arm hung without reporting readiness.
This is deliberate Option B ordering: the fleet is protected before the model handles the wake whenever restoration succeeds, but the model is never left blind when it does not.

Claude's Stop hook starts the successor arm at the next Stop after the handling turn, rather than before notification as Pi and OpenCode do.
The durable wake queue preserves actionable events during the residual active-turn window, and the bounded turn-end guard enforces recovery at Stop when no watcher or auto-arm claim is present.
For every supported arm path, a successor that observes an accepted down stretch emits `check: rearm-resurface` through the ordinary durable handling path before settling into its live wait.
That recovery presentation includes all unacknowledged queue rows and the existing cursor-folded OPEN DECISIONS set, so a still-open decision reappears even when recovery has no queue row of its own.
The model no longer re-arms after ordinary wakes.
No PreToolUse hook denies fleet commands based on watcher status.
A genuine auto-arm failure describes the automatic mechanism as broken and never directs a routine manual background arm.
Terminal arm-output classification (`started`, `attached`, or `FAILED`) remains defense in depth for the manual recovery path.
Codex retains its bounded foreground checkpoint protocol.
Grok retains its tracked background-task notification protocol.
No adapter starts a replacement with shell `&`.

The turn-end guard remains the final backstop rather than the normal continuity mechanism and cooperates with the auto-arm in its `--claude` mode.

## Recovery episode acknowledgement

A recovery episode is one generation of `state/.watcher-down`, and it is retired only by the generation-bound acknowledgement the drain prints as `WAKE_ACK_REQUIRED`.
Every watcher close and every durable queue append publishes downtime, so a downtime republication of any pending episode reuses its generation instead of minting a new one.
That reuse keeps a watcher close inside the handling window from orphaning the acknowledgement already presented and trapping later arms in repeated recovery presentation.
An acknowledgement carries two separable facts: queue-row consumption is bound to the monotonic `--ack-through` sequence, while only retiring the episode is bound to `--recovery-generation`.
A generation mismatch therefore does not block consumption of rows through that sequence; it is a non-fatal result that names its own remedy - re-drain, then acknowledge the newer episode.
The acknowledgement retires the marker only when no rows remain after sequence-bound consumption.
A concurrently appended wake has a higher sequence, remains queued, and keeps the episode pending for presentation.
Consequently, an empty-queue downtime publication during handling can be retired by the outstanding acknowledgement without a dedicated recovery turn.
An acknowledged episode does not freeze the generation, because the next downtime after it opens an episode of its own.

## Arm-layer cycle contract

`bin/fm-watch-arm.sh` never returns a clean empty success.
An actionable child output returns that reason normally.
A zero/empty child return rechecks the home lock and beacon, attaches to a verified healthy successor when one exists, or resolves the close against the watcher's bounded terminal-delivery ledger.
An attached arm follows verified identity-matched successors and resolves the same way when that chain ends without one, because it holds no handle on the watcher's stdout and cannot read the reason line itself.
Before releasing its singleton lock after printing an actionable reason, the watcher records that reason with its PID and process identity in `state/.watch-deliveries.log`.
A matching PID and identity lets an attached arm report the delivered reason and exit zero even after its durable wake was handled and acknowledged, while an unrelated queue producer or a recycled PID cannot satisfy the match.
Only a cycle with no matching delivery record emits `watcher: FAILED - cycle ended without an actionable reason` and exits nonzero.

The arm layer appends one tab-separated record per observed cycle to `state/.watch-cycle-exits.log`.
Each record includes arm and watcher PIDs, start and end timestamps, exit code and signal, classified reason, beacon age, lock identity before and after close, and successor disposition.
The file is size-capped through `FM_WATCH_CYCLE_LOG_MAX_BYTES` and `FM_WATCH_CYCLE_LOG_KEEP_LINES`.
`state/.watch-triage.log` remains only the watcher's bounded absorbed-wake debug log and carries no lifecycle semantics.

The default 300-second grace is unchanged.
Only the watcher process touches `state/.last-watcher-beat`; no helper process can make a wedged watcher appear healthy.

## Signal safety across lock critical sections

A signal arriving while a recovery-marker or wake-queue critical section is open is held until that section closes and is then re-raised against the process's own disposition, so no cycle can end with a marker or queue record half written.
`bin/fm-wake-lib.sh` owns that mechanism and the bound that keeps a held signal from waiting on another process's lifetime.
Shutdown is separately bounded: watcher cleanup and the away-mode daemon's child reap give up loudly rather than block, so TERM stops a watcher from every position in its poll loop and a stuck child cannot hang daemon shutdown.
A cleanup that gives up keeps the existing stale-lock-evidence outcome above, which the next arm reclaims through the ordinary dead-holder path.

## Regression coverage

`tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh` checks Pi's first-cycle-or-explicit-repair tool metadata and ownership-based redundant-call no-ops, then simulates actionable and empty child closes against the actual Pi and OpenCode close handlers, blocks prompt delivery to prove the successor launches first, verifies single-flight behavior, changes the session lock before close to prove ownership is rechecked, and hangs each successor arm to prove bounded fallback delivery includes the typed restoration failure.
The same suite covers ordinary same-process session replacement for `/new`, `/resume`, and `/fork`, same-instance shutdown-plus-start, stale prior-generation callbacks, repeated transitions with exactly one live cycle, disappearance of the shutting-down refusal after a valid replacement activates, and terminal quit still refusing late rearm.
`tests/fm-watch-arm.test.sh` covers durable queue replay, real remote parent-replies ingestion into the authoritative status log, decision-only OPEN DECISIONS recovery, interrupted handling replay, generation-bound acknowledgement, a persistent live successor after recovery, a watcher close inside the handling window that must leave the printed acknowledgement valid, and the self-healing moved-generation acknowledgement that consumes its handled rows and names its remedy.
`tests/fm-watcher-lock.test.sh` covers verified-successor attach, recovery publication before stale-lock removal, the typed self-eviction failure, bounded and successor-linked lifecycle rows, and a SIGSTOP counterfactual that distinguishes a live PID from a stale beacon before classifying termination.
`tests/fm-watcher-signal-safety.test.sh` pins the signal-safety contract with real processes and real signals: a held signal lets its section finish and then fires through the caller's own handler, a watcher signalled while pinned in a contended marker section exits without abandoning the queue lock, TERM stops the watcher and frees its singleton lock from every position in the poll cycle, and both the watcher's cleanup and the daemon's child reap stay bounded against a holder or child that never yields.
`tests/fm-subagent-pretool-check.test.sh` proves Claude retains only the non-status Bash seatbelts.
`tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.test.sh` covers the auto-arm's scope, stale and live session owners, unchanged AFK and need boundaries, single-flight, bounded failure retries, benign live-watcher cycle ends, one-notice failure episodes, and exit-2 translation.
`FM_CLAUDE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm-live-e2e.test.sh` starts with the reproduced stale-lock state, runs session start first, completes two tokenless cycles, and checks the competing-live-owner negative control.
`tests/fm-turnend-guard.test.sh` covers the cooperative `--claude` guard, including monotonic failed-epoch progression, the integrated bounded fail-open, post-alarm continuation suppression, and positive recovery reset.

## Active limits and verification

The goal is continuity without a Pi or OpenCode model-memory re-arm step.
No zero-latency guarantee is claimed because lock verification, watcher startup, and bounded retry delays remain deliberate safety work.
OpenCode support targets persistent TUI sessions rather than headless `opencode run`.
Claude depends on the Stop `asyncRewake` rewake, Grok retains native background-completion notifications, and Codex retains bounded foreground checkpoints.

[`verification/supervision.md`](verification/supervision.md#watcher-continuity) records the current five-harness live evidence, the 2026-07-24 Stop-owned Claude auto-arm results, and exact opt-in commands.
