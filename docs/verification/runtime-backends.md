# Runtime backend verification

Audience: maintainer verification.

This record contains reusable version-scoped evidence for active runtime guarantees.
The backend guides own current setup, safety boundaries, and limitations.
Exact task chronology, branch names, temporary homes, local paths, process ids, thread ids, and delivery transcripts remain in private reports or PR evidence.

## Harness detection precedence

Firstmate's own harness comes from two kinds of evidence, and `bin/fm-harness.sh` owns how they combine: an environment marker names its harness, and the nearest harness process in the parent chain proves who owns the process tree.
A marker alone is not proof of ownership, because it is ordinary environment state that a child inherits and a terminal multiplexer can replay into an unrelated session.
Verified on 2026-09-02 on Linux 7.1.12 with the portable regression, which builds every case from real renamed processes and no installed harness:

```sh
bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-harness-precedence.test.sh
```

Observed output:

```text
ok - a markerless harness keeps its identity under an inherited foreign marker
ok - a harness that publishes a marker inside its own process tree is unchanged
ok - with ancestry silent, the marker layer and its cursor-first ordering still decide
ok - a retained cursor marker does not rename a nested claude worker
ok - an agreeing marker keeps Pi's finer identity that ancestry cannot prove
ok - an interpreter script-path match answers alone but never outranks a marker
ok - a native harness binary under an interpreter shim decides at comm strength
ok - a harness that is pid 1 of its own namespace is examined, not skipped
ok - the descent probe reaches comm strength where the top-of-session probe sees only args
ok - the descent probe reports no verdict from a sibling branch detection cannot reach
ok - a foreign args-only verdict at the deepest vantage leaves the comm-strength identity intact
ok - equal-depth descent ties prefer the comm-strength leaf regardless of spawn order
ok - session start renders the Codex protocol for a Codex primary holding a retained CLAUDECODE
FM_TEST_SUMMARY total=1 failed=0 skipped_gate=0 duration_ms=3666
```

Before that boundary existed, a Codex session started from an environment that had retained `CLAUDECODE=1` reported `claude`, and session start emitted Claude's Stop-owned supervision protocol to a Codex primary.
The same live shape, reproduced with a real process named `codex` and no installed harness, now reports `codex` with the marker present and `claude` with the marker present and ancestry blinded, which is what proves the case is not vacuous.

### A real Codex session holding a retained Claude marker

The portable regression builds its process tree from renamed executables, so the same guarantee is proven again against the real installed Codex.
`codex sandbox` runs a command under the installed native binary with no model turn, inside a PID namespace where that binary is pid 1 and the command is pid 2.
Verified on 2026-09-01 with codex-cli 0.152.0 on Linux 7.1.10, with both Claude markers retained in the launching environment:

```sh
CLAUDECODE=1 CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=cli codex sandbox bash -c \
  'cd <checkout> && bin/fm-harness.sh; bin/fm-harness.sh ancestry; bin/fm-supervision-instructions.sh'
```

Against the parent commit, with `CLAUDECODE=1` and `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT=cli` confirmed present in the probe's own environment and the chain reading pid 2 `bash` to pid 1 `codex`:

```text
verdict=claude
SUPERVISION OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS - primary harness: claude
Mode: Claude Stop-hook-owned supervision.
```

With the current boundaries in place, from the same command and the same process chain:

```text
verdict=codex
ancestry=comm codex
SUPERVISION OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS - primary harness: codex
Mode: Codex foreground checkpoint.
```

Two boundaries are load-bearing here, and the marker-versus-ancestry precedence above is only the first.
The walk also used to stop as soon as the next pid was 1, on the assumption that pid 1 is always init.
That assumption inverts inside a PID namespace, where the harness is pid 1: the walk returned no ancestry at all, so the retained marker won by default even with precedence corrected.
The walk now examines that top process before stopping, which costs one `ps` call and can introduce no false positive, because a host's real pid 1 (init, systemd, launchd) matches no harness name.
The portable regression asserts both directions of that case: a host-shaped pid 1 still leaves the marker to answer, and a harness at pid 1 outranks it.

Run on the host under Claude Code 2.1.252 with the same two markers set, the same probe reports `claude`, `comm claude`, and Claude's Stop-owned protocol, so the correction does not trade one misidentification for its inverse.

### Real harness process names behind the walk

The detection half of the opt-in drift guard asks the ancestry walk what it makes of each INSTALLED harness's real running process:

```sh
FM_HARNESS_LIVENESS_DRIFT=1 bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-harness-liveness-drift-live-e2e.test.sh
```

The guard probes the upward path between the deepest foreground descendant of the pane process and the pane process itself, and reports each distinct verdict that vantage set produces.
Observed on 2026-09-02 for the harnesses installed on that machine:

```text
# claude 2.1.258 (Claude Code): title='claude' foreground=[claude ]
# claude 2.1.258 (Claude Code): ancestry verdicts=[comm claude]
# codex codex-cli 0.152.0: title='node' foreground=[node codex ]
# codex codex-cli 0.152.0: ancestry verdicts=[comm codex;args codex]
```

The verdicts are reported deepest first, so Codex's native child answers before the shim above it.
When eligible foreground descendants tie at the greatest depth, the probe prefers a leaf whose own verdict reaches comm strength; if none does, it keeps the first leaf, so process-table ordering cannot hide an equally deep native harness binary behind an args-strength interpreter.

Codex ships as a `node` npm shim that spawns its native `codex` binary as a foreground child, which is why its two verdicts differ: the pane process is identified only from the shim's script path, and the native child is what carries the process name.
That difference is the reason the guard cannot probe the pane process alone.
The guarantee this guard holds is a strength claim, not only an identity one, because `detect_own` hands an args-strength verdict straight back to a retained foreign marker.
A pane-only probe would have observed `args codex`, passed, and gone on passing if a later release stopped spawning the native child, while real sessions silently regressed to the original bug.
Probing from below asks the question from the vantage a tool subprocess actually occupies, so the guard can require comm strength somewhere in the session and require every comm-strength vantage to name the same harness.
The vantage set stops at the upward path rather than the whole subtree, because `harness_ancestry` only ever climbs and a sibling branch is therefore a vantage firstmate's own detection can never occupy.
The reject-other-harness cross-check judges comm-strength vantages only, because an args-strength verdict is path-ambiguous by construction: a harness-spawned MCP server running as `node <home>/.claude/mcp/<server>.js` answers `args claude` purely from the `.claude` path component, and such a server is normally a child of the agent binary, so it can be the deepest descendant and sit on this path.
That narrowing changes only which vantages the cross-check judges; the comm-strength requirement itself is unchanged.
A single-process harness has no descendant that adds a distinct verdict, which is why `claude` reports one.
The portable regression pins every half without any harness installed: `tests/fm-harness-precedence.test.sh` asserts that this two-process topology decides at comm strength, that the descent probe reaches a strength the top-of-session probe cannot, that a sibling branch answering a foreign harness contributes no verdict, that a foreign args-only verdict at the deepest vantage leaves the comm-strength identity intact, and that equal-depth ties choose the comm-strength leaf regardless of process ordering.
The run did not reach `opencode`, `pi`, `pi-signed`, `grok`, `kimi`, or `muse`, which were not installed, and stopped at the same pre-existing liveness failure for `cursor` 3.18.9, whose resolved binary on that machine is the editor rather than `cursor-agent`; those adapters are unverified by this run.

## tmux

Foreground-process behavior was verified on 2026-07-07 with tmux 3.6a on macOS.

```sh
tmux new-session -d -s fmtest -n testwin
tmux display-message -p -t fmtest:testwin '#{pane_current_command}'
tmux send-keys -t fmtest:testwin 'sleep 30' Enter
tmux display-message -p -t fmtest:testwin '#{pane_current_command}'
tmux send-keys -t fmtest:testwin C-c
tmux display-message -p -t fmtest:testwin '#{pane_current_command}'
```

Observed output:

```text
zsh
sleep
zsh
```

A persistent parent shell waiting for a child remained reported as the parent process, while a shell that directly execed a simple command changed identity with the process itself.
Pi and pi-signed 0.82.0 were reverified on 2026-07-27 through real isolated `fm-spawn.sh` launches.

### Agent liveness name sources

The earlier record that every harness is observed under its own `#{pane_current_command}` no longer holds and has been replaced by the per-harness evidence below.
In this macOS run that reading reflected a rewritable process title rather than stable executable identity, so it is now one of two independent name sources rather than the sole basis of a verdict.

The seven primary-capable adapters were relaunched on 2026-08-03 with tmux 3.6a on macOS 26.5.2 arm64, each on a private socket in an isolated lab.

```sh
tmux -L "$socket" new-window -d -t "$session:" -n "$harness" -c "$wt" -- "$bin"
tmux -L "$socket" display-message -p -t "$session:$harness" '#{pane_current_command}'
ps -t "${tty#/dev/}" -o pgid=,tpgid=,comm=      # rows where pgid = tpgid
```

Observed identities, and the resulting verdict:

| Harness | Version | `#{pane_current_command}` | Foreground `comm` | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| claude | 2.1.220 | `2.1.220` | `claude` | alive |
| codex | codex-cli 0.146.0 | `codex` | `codex` | alive |
| opencode | 1.18.11 | `opencode` | `opencode` | alive |
| pi | 0.82.0 | `pi-launcher` | `pi-signed`, `pi` | alive |
| pi-signed | 0.82.0 | `pi-launcher` | `pi-signed`, `pi` | alive |
| grok | 0.2.118 | `grok-0.2.118-ma` | `grok` | alive |
| kimi | 0.31.1 | `kimi` | `kimi` | alive |

In that 2026-08-03 seven-adapter run, Claude Code was the only harness whose title did not attribute it; every other adapter was attributed by both sources.
Codex reported `codex-aarch64-a` at 0.145.0 and `codex` at 0.146.0, and Kimi Code reported `kimi-code` as its foreground `comm` at 0.29.1 and `kimi` at 0.31.1, so these identities move between ordinary patch releases in both directions.
That is the evidence for treating any single process name as a surface under vendor control rather than a stable contract.

The crewmate-only Muse Code 0.1.0-R708.1 adapter was verified separately on 2026-08-05 against tmux on macOS arm64.
Its installed `muse-bin-0.1.0-R708.1` foreground identity classified `alive`, while `musescore`, `amuse`, `muse-binary`, and `muse-bind` remained ambiguous in the portable regression.
[`muse.md`](muse.md#process-identity) owns the artifact identity and launcher evidence for that verification.

The crewmate/scout-only Rovo CLI 202609.1.2 adapter added `*rovo*` to the same glob family as `*grok*`/`*kimi*` in the shared process-name classifier (now `fm_agent_process_classify_name` in `bin/fm-agent-process-lib.sh`), and was relaunched live under tmux 3.6a in an isolated private socket.
`#{pane_current_command}` reported the truncated on-disk binary name `atlassian_cli_r` - macOS's 15-char `comm` truncation cuts `atlassian_cli_rovodev` off just before the `rovo` substring begins, the same truncation-volatility class codex/kimi's own patch-release name drift shows above - while the foreground ps-based `comm` correctly reported `rovo`, so `fm_backend_tmux_agent_state` returned `alive` through that primary source; the two-independent-name-sources design is exactly why the truncated title does not break the verdict.
[`rovo.md`](rovo.md#backend-liveness-tmux-verified-live-herdr-placement-verified-live-with-a-herdr-side-agent-detection-gap) owns the fuller record, including the busy/interrupt/exit facts captured in that same live tmux session and the herdr agent-detection gap found when herdr placement was verified live in an isolated lab session.

Bounded observed output:

```text
foreground comms:
  zsh
  .../instbin/muse-bin-0.1.0-R708.1
classify each:
  zsh                            -> shell
  muse-bin-0.1.0-R708.1          -> agent
fm_backend_agent_state tmux museliv:zsh
alive
```

`#{pane_current_command}` and foreground `ps -o comm=` read different name fields, but which one preserves executable identity is platform-dependent.
On macOS the pane command reflected the rewritable title while the full install path could survive in `ps -o comm=`; in the Linux portable regression those roles reversed for the version-named native executable, with the identifying path retained in argv[0].
The classifier therefore accepts a harness basename first, then an exact harness path component in the full executable path, then the same component in argv[0], without depending on which field carries it on a given platform.

The portable regression is CI-enforced.
The real-harness drift guard spends no model tokens, so under the policy in `.agents/skills/firstmate-coding-guidelines/SKILL.md` it runs by default wherever tmux is installed and reports a capability skip elsewhere; `FM_HARNESS_LIVENESS_DRIFT=1` additionally turns an absent tool into a failure.
Run the live guard after any harness upgrade and before trusting or refreshing the table above:

```sh
FM_HARNESS_LIVENESS_DRIFT=1 bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-harness-liveness-drift-live-e2e.test.sh
```

### 2026-09-06 default-on drift refresh, and the Cursor editor CLI collision

Running the guard with no variable set on macOS 26.5.2 arm64 checked 8 installed harnesses and classified every one `alive`:

```text
# claude 2.1.263 (Claude Code): title='2.1.263' foreground=[/Users/kunchen/.local/bin/claude <defunct> <defunct> ]
# codex codex-cli 0.147.0: title='codex' foreground=[/opt/homebrew/bin/codex ]
# opencode 1.18.29: title='opencode' foreground=[/opt/homebrew/bin/opencode ]
# pi 0.84.4: title='pi-launcher' foreground=[/opt/homebrew/bin/pi-signed .../pi ]
# pi-signed 0.84.4: title='pi-launcher' foreground=[/opt/homebrew/bin/pi-signed .../pi ]
# grok grok 1.0.13 (5e9a58528b76) [stable]: title='grok-1.0.13-mac' foreground=[/Users/kunchen/.local/bin/grok ]
# cursor 2026.09.02-c22c1a3: title='node' foreground=[/Users/kunchen/.local/bin/cursor-agent ]
# muse Muse Code 1.0.3 (1.0.3-R2198.1): title='muse-bin-1.0.3-' foreground=[/Users/kunchen/.local/bin/muse-bin-1.0.3-R2198.1 ]
# checked 8 installed harness(es)
```

The first default-on run failed on Cursor with `LIVENESS DRIFT: cursor unknown is running but classifies 'missing'`, observed title `zsh`.
The classifier was not at fault: the guard resolved the harness through a generic `command -v cursor`, which on a machine that also has the Cursor editor finds `~/.local/bin/cursor` - the editor launcher, not the agent.
That binary exits immediately, leaving a bare shell in the pane.
The guard now asks `fm_cursor_resolve_binary` first for `cursor`, which is the same verified owner `bin/fm-spawn.sh` uses, so the probe launches `cursor-agent` and the editor CLI can no longer masquerade as the harness.

Bounded output from the 2026-08-03 run that produced the first table above:

```text
ok - harness liveness: claude 2.1.220 (Claude Code) classifies alive
# claude 2.1.220 (Claude Code): title='2.1.220' foreground=[claude ]
# checked 7 installed harness(es)
```

Installed-wrapper checks:

```sh
basename "$(command -v pi-signed)"
pi-signed --version
pi --version
```

Observed bounded output:

```text
pi-signed
0.82.0
0.82.0
```

### Harness-adapter instruction routing

Two checks keep the evidence boundaries separate.
`tests/fm-harness-adapter-references.test.sh` parses the router's declared JSON contract as normalized data and proves every selected reference is readable, which is structural evidence only.
`tests/fm-harness-adapter-instructions-live-e2e.test.sh` is an opt-in development check that sends the directly loaded router and every operation scenario across all nine harness identities to a local Ollama model, requires the generated plan as normalized JSON, and makes no external-provider call.

```sh
FM_HARNESS_ADAPTER_INSTRUCTION_EVAL=1 FM_HARNESS_ADAPTER_LOCAL_MODEL=ambient-router-gemma4:e4b bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-harness-adapter-instructions-live-e2e.test.sh
```

That local evaluation demonstrates instruction-driven scenario selection, but it does not claim that a native harness loaded the selected files.
The guard prints the exact installed version or unavailable status for every native harness so absent tools and unexercised provider transports remain explicit rather than becoming passes.
Native loader behavior still requires the applicable live agent-tool check; no uniform deterministic zero-provider transport currently spans Claude, Codex, OpenCode, and Pi, and the other five tools remain unavailable where their binaries are absent.

Bounded output from the 2026-08-29 local run:

```text
ok - local model ambient-router-gemma4:e4b selected every operation scenario and all nine harness identities
# native loader not claimed: claude 2.1.220 (Claude Code) is installed, but this harness-neutral evaluation does not exercise its provider transport
# native loader not claimed: codex 0.147.0-alpha.6+local.4 is installed, but this harness-neutral evaluation does not exercise its provider transport
# native loader not claimed: opencode 1.14.48 is installed, but this harness-neutral evaluation does not exercise its provider transport
# native loader not claimed: pi 0.84.0 is installed, but this harness-neutral evaluation does not exercise its provider transport
# unverified native loader: pi-signed is not installed on this machine
# unverified native loader: grok is not installed on this machine
# unverified native loader: kimi is not installed on this machine
# unverified native loader: cursor is not installed on this machine
# unverified native loader: muse is not installed on this machine
# installed native tools recorded without overstating loader coverage: 4
# unavailable native tools: pi-signed grok kimi cursor muse
```

The isolated process and endpoint checks used:

```sh
tmux display-message -p -t "$target" '#{pane_current_command}'
ps -o comm= -p "$wrapper_pid"
ps -o comm= -p "$engine_pid"
FM_HOME="$fixture_home" bin/fm-crew-state.sh "$task_id"
```

Observed bounded shapes:

```text
pi-launcher
.../pi-signed
.../Pi Launcher.app/Contents/Resources/pi/pi
state: done ...
```

Both launches executed a submitted tool instruction and touched the generated `turn_end` marker.
The pi-signed launch retained `harness=pi-signed`, while the plain comparison retained `harness=pi`.
The exact wrapper ancestry was `pi-signed` parent to Pi engine child, and the plain Pi Launcher path also traversed the signed wrapper on this installation.
That shared plain-Pi path is retained as disconfirming evidence against using ancestry as runtime-selection authority.
Firstmate therefore sets the exact `FM_PI_HARNESS` selection marker on both worker launch paths, while an unmarked Pi-family process remains `pi`.
Both recorded runtime identities now classify the exact `pi-launcher` foreground command as `alive`.

Backend applicability was reviewed across every spawn adapter.
Tmux needs the exact `pi-launcher`, `pi-signed`, `pi`, and `Pi` process identities for recovery-grade liveness.
Herdr uses native registered-agent state and needs no process-name branch.
Zellij has no verified recovery-grade agent process probe, while Orca and cmux do not support secondmate spawns, so those three retain their existing generic ordinary-launch semantics without a new liveness matcher.

The current classifier matrix and its refresh guard are recorded in [Composer classification matrix](#composer-classification-matrix), with portable shape coverage in `tests/fm-composer-lib.test.sh` and `tests/fm-composer-ghost.test.sh`.
Kimi pointer delivery and OpenCode 1.18.4 busy-queue behavior remain pinned by `tests/fm-kimi-harness.test.sh`, `tests/fm-tmux-submit-busy.test.sh`, and `tests/fm-composer-lib.test.sh`.
Herdr's Claude idle-native submit confirmation is pinned by `tests/fm-backend-herdr.test.sh` and refreshed by `FM_HERDR_SUBMIT_CONFIRM_LIVE=1 tests/fm-herdr-submit-confirm-live-e2e.test.sh`.

### Cleanup endpoint identity

The cleanup identity boundary was validated on 2026-07-28 with tmux 3.6a and metadata fixtures for every supported backend.

```sh
tests/fm-teardown-endpoint-safety.test.sh
tests/fm-teardown.test.sh
tests/fm-backend-herdr.test.sh
tests/fm-backend-zellij.test.sh
tests/fm-backend-orca.test.sh
tests/fm-backend-cmux.test.sh
```

Bounded output from the incident regression:

```text
ok - fm-teardown: missing, empty, malformed, ambiguous, and task-mismatched endpoints refuse before every mutation or runtime call
ok - cleanup identity: valid tmux, Herdr, Zellij, Orca, and cmux records validate while every empty backend target refuses
ok - tmux backend: direct empty target returns nonzero without invoking tmux
ok - process cleanup: creation-time PID identity removes only the exact child and preserves the control child
ok - fm-teardown: dedicated-socket invalid cleanup preserves target/control and valid cleanup removes only the exact target
```

The dedicated tmux cell removed ambient tmux variables, required a socket-bound wrapper, kept one target and one independent control window, and proved the wrapper was not called for invalid metadata or a direct empty target.
Valid cleanup removed only the exact task-bound target and left the control window live.
The metadata-only validation covers tmux, Herdr, Zellij, Orca, and cmux before backend dispatch.
Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, pi-signed, Grok, Kimi, Cursor, and Muse share that backend cleanup boundary; their harness-specific hook files, tokens, transcript bindings, and session-log sidecars are cleaned only after it, so no harness needs a separate endpoint parser.

### Endpoint close

A reported close failure costs teardown every durable record of the task, so what each backend's close actually returns was measured before that status was given any authority.
Verified on 2026-09-14 with tmux 3.7c by driving `fm_backend_kill` against real tmux endpoints, and the Orca arm by driving `fm_backend_orca_kill` under a search path with no `orca` on it.
Zellij and cmux were not driven with their CLIs absent; the table below states what those arms report today rather than claiming a measurement.

```sh
tests/fm-teardown-endpoint-safety.test.sh
tests/fm-backend-orca.test.sh
```

```text
ok - fm-teardown: a close that genuinely failed refuses and keeps the record naming the surviving endpoint, and the same teardown finishes once the close works
ok - fm-teardown: --force continues past a close it could not make while still reporting it, and the same case refuses without --force
ok - fm-teardown: a close re-read that could not run refuses, while a definitively absent session or server still completes silently
ok - fm-teardown: forced secondmate cleanup still refuses on a child endpoint close that failed
ok - fm-teardown: an Orca close its missing CLI never attempted refuses even under --force, keeping the record naming the terminal
ok - fm-teardown: an already-exited endpoint, and a server that is already gone, still complete cleanup silently
ok - fm_backend_orca_kill: a close its missing CLI never attempted reports the failure instead of a success
```

An endpoint that is already legitimately gone returns 0 silently on every arm, so ordinary cleanup of an already-exited session is unchanged: real tmux returns 0 for a live window, for a re-close of that same gone window, and for a close into a session whose whole server has exited.
The refusal is reached only through a close that could not do its job, and each arm reports only what it can prove:

| Backend | already gone | a close that failed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tmux | 0, silent | 1, resolved by re-reading the window's exact recorded identity; a read that itself could not run refuses rather than passing for absence |
| orca | 0, silent | 1 when a missing CLI means no close was attempted; 0 for a close command that failed after the CLI accepted it |
| zellij | 0, silent | 0, not yet distinguishable |
| cmux | 0, silent | 0, not yet distinguishable |
| herdr | 0, silent | 0 from this arm; `bin/fm-teardown.sh` gates every Herdr record removal on `fm_backend_herdr_endpoint_confirmed_gone` instead |

The three arms that still report 0 need a presence re-read taken after their own close, and the close-then-read timing that re-read depends on cannot be established without the real Zellij, Orca, and cmux binaries.
Guessing it is what a refusal must never rest on: a gate that refused an already-exited session would break ordinary cleanup on every task, which is a worse failure than the stranded endpoint it would be trying to prevent.
tmux's re-read is deliberately exact - `=session` plus a whole-line window-name match - because a prefix match would read a neighboring window as this window's survivor, which is the same exactness the cleanup identity boundary above already requires.
It is also deliberately conservative about the read itself, sharing `fm_backend_tmux_window_inventory` with `fm_backend_tmux_agent_state` so both mean the same thing by an absent session: only a definitive missing-session, missing-server, or connect-error response proves the window gone.
Any other read failure - a momentarily unresponsive server, or a teardown PATH without tmux on it - refuses, because a read that could not run is not evidence of absence.

Two bounds of the refusal are known and deliberately not closed here.

`--force` overrides it at exactly one site, the generic non-Herdr/non-Orca close.
That is the only close where continuing is actually reachable: the worktree is already returned by then and nothing after it needs the backend that could not close, so `--force` - the operator's existing authority to discard a task's records - can mean something there.
A forced run still prints the full diagnosis naming the backend, the target, and that the close failed, so what may survive is never silent.
It states what `--force` authorizes rather than what will have happened, because a later refusal in the same run - the Herdr confirmed-gone gate, or the inactive-reconcile delivery gate - can still stop it with every record retained.

The Orca close refuses under `--force` too.
The step immediately after it removes the Orca worktree through the same CLI whose absence is the only thing that arm ever reports, so a forced continue would die there having removed nothing while claiming the records were already gone.
The two child close sites inside forced secondmate cleanup also keep refusing: that path is only ever reached under `--force`, so honoring force there would delete the refusal rather than override it, and would contradict the adjacent Herdr child gate that stops forced cleanup for the same hazard.

The retained record is this run's, not a durable guarantee.
A task carrying a backlog transition writes its pending-close marker before the endpoint close, and the marker survives the refusal; the next `bin/fm-bootstrap.sh` replays it and removes the retained record.
The pre-existing Herdr confirmed-gone gate has the identical property.
The refusal message says so rather than promising a retention teardown does not own, so an operator reconciles the surviving endpoint instead of trusting the record to still be there later.

Both directions are proven non-vacuous.
Restoring the swallowed status makes the refusal case report `teardown <id> complete`, delete the endpoint record, and leave the window live.
Keeping the refusal but dropping the exact re-read makes an already-exited endpoint refuse its own cleanup, and also fails the cleanup identity case above.
Letting an unreadable inventory pass for absence makes the unreadable case complete and remove the record while the window is still there.
Removing the `--force` arm makes the forced generic case refuse; honoring `--force` at the child sites makes forced secondmate cleanup continue past a child endpoint it could not close, and honoring it at the Orca site makes that forced cleanup abort on the missing CLI after announcing that it was continuing.
Restoring `fm_backend_orca_kill`'s swallowed tool check makes the CLI-absent adapter case report success.
Dropping the retention-is-not-durable line makes the refusal claim a retention teardown does not own.

## Claude workspace trust

Verified 2026-09-03 on Claude Code 2.1.259.
Claude gates a folder it has never seen behind an interactive workspace-trust dialog, and the CLI documents the only bypass as non-interactive mode, which a crewmate pane is not.

```

`--dangerously-skip-permissions` is a permission control and is absent from that bypass, so an interactive worker in a fresh worktree still reaches the dialog.
Firstmate cannot answer it either, because its key plane carries only Enter, Escape, and C-c with no arrow navigation.
Suppression itself was then observed directly on the same date and version, with a control arm and a treatment arm.

The control arm launched a fresh linked worktree with no pre-registration, the way `bin/fm-spawn.sh` launches one.

```sh
tmux new-session -d -s tp-a -c /tmp/trustproof/wt-a \
  "CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<cfg> CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_PROMPT_SUGGESTION=false claude --dangerously-skip-permissions '<brief>'"
```

```
Accessing workspace: /tmp/trustproof/wt-a
Quick safety check: Is this a project you created or one you trust? ...
Claude Code'll be able to read, edit, and execute files here.
> No, exit
  Yes, I trust this folder
Enter to confirm . Esc to cancel
```

That pane confirms two load-bearing claims at once: the dialog fires despite `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, and the selection cursor sits on `No, exit`, so a sent Enter would have exited the worker.

The treatment arm pre-registered an equivalent fresh worktree and launched it identically against the operator's real config.

```sh
bin/fm-claude-trust.sh /tmp/trustproof/wt-c /tmp/trustproof/proj
tmux new-session -d -s tp-c -c /tmp/trustproof/wt-c \
  "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_PROMPT_SUGGESTION=false claude --dangerously-skip-permissions 'reply with exactly: BRIEF-REACHED'"
```

```
trusted: /tmp/trustproof/wt-c
```

```
Claude Code v2.1.259 ... /tmp/trustproof/wt-c
> reply with exactly: BRIEF-REACHED
. BRIEF-REACHED
```

No dialog appeared and the worker executed its brief with zero keypresses.
The scratch repo was deleted and the test entries were removed from the store and verified absent.
That verification is point-in-time rather than a durable guarantee, because a concurrent Claude session can re-add a path it visited: one entry reappeared after an earlier zero-residual check, most plausibly flushed by a session as it exited, and was removed again.

One limitation belongs beside that result.
An intermediate arm run against an isolated `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` holding only a copied `.claude.json` cleared the trust dialog but then surfaced the separate machine-scoped Bypass Permissions warning.
That warning rendered in the same shape as the trust dialog, with the selection cursor on `No, exit` and the footer `Enter to confirm . Esc to cancel`, so a sent Enter would end that worker too.
That gate is not a production blocker, because a normal environment has already accepted it and the treatment arm above ran against the real config and saw neither dialog.
This change does not address that warning and does not claim to.

### Secondmate homes

Verified 2026-09-11 on Claude Code 2.1.269.
A secondmate launches in its own firstmate home rather than a task worktree, and that home meets the same gate.
The control arm launched a standalone-clone secondmate home that the store had no entry for, the way `bin/fm-spawn.sh --secondmate` launches one.

```sh
tmux -L <sock> new-session -d -s ctrl -x 180 -y 44 -c <home> \
  "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_PROMPT_SUGGESTION=false claude --dangerously-skip-permissions"
```

```

The treatment arm pre-registered that same home through the secondmate-home mode and launched it identically against the operator's real config.

```sh
bin/fm-claude-trust.sh --secondmate-home <home> livemate-n1
```

```
trusted: /private/tmp/fm-sm-trust-live-69759/fm-homes/livemate-n1
```

```

No dialog appeared, the composer was reached, and neither did the machine-scoped bypass warning, because this ran against the real config.
The lab home was deleted and the test entry was removed from the store and verified absent, with the same point-in-time caveat as the worktree arms above.

`bin/fm-spawn.sh` therefore pre-registers the directory every claude launch starts in through `bin/fm-claude-trust.sh` before launch, and `tests/fm-claude-trust.test.sh` pins both halves of the scope contract for both shapes: a fresh worktree and a seeded secondmate home are trusted, and an out-of-scope path is refused.
That automated spawn case runs against a fake claude, so it asserts the store entry and the launch command and nothing more; the live arms above are what establish that the entry actually suppresses the dialog.
The composer-classification record below observes the same gate from the other side, where an untrusted worktree left Claude, Grok, and Muse unverified because the guard reads a first-launch trust dialog as an unreadable composer.

## Launch-prompt backstop signatures

`bin/fm-busy-lib.sh`'s launch-prompt backstop (`fm_busy_launch_prompt_parked`) reclassifies a launch whose busy record is still pinned at the fm-spawn seed as `unknown launch-prompt`, rather than `busy fm-spawn`, when the captured pane matches that harness's own recognized trust, sign-in, or first-run dialog.
Each signature below was live-verified against the real installed binary through `tests/fm-launch-prompt-signals-live-e2e.test.sh` (`FM_LAUNCH_PROMPT_SIGNALS_LIVE=1`), which is what refreshes this record after an upgrade.

An initial Pi signature sourced only from the installed binary's own UI strings ("Project trust", the internal panel-title component, never the dialog's own rendered heading) was wrong and never matched the real screen.
This guard's first live run caught that before it shipped, which is the evidence for why this class of check must be driven end to end rather than read off strings or a component name.

Verified 2026-09-22 on Claude Code 2.1.278, pi 0.86.1, and gemini 0.60.0.

Gemini, launched `GEMINI_CLI_TRUST_WORKSPACE=true gemini -y` with no `GEMINI_API_KEY` and no prior OAuth credential:

```

```

The real pane renders this inside a bordered box, omitted here for readability; that border is exactly what proves the point below.

That capture demonstrated why each signature function matches the FULL captured tail rather than the Grok/Rovo/AGY busy-footer convention of the last 12 non-blank lines: a bordered dialog box renders many short lines of pure border and padding (`│  ...  │`) that are NOT whitespace-only, so the 12-line reduction pushed this exact heading text out of the window and silently defeated the match on the first attempt.
None of these three runs ever answered its dialog (Escape only, never Enter), so no credential store was written to and no model tokens were spent.

## Worker account pin sign-in check

`bin/fm-worker-account-lib.sh` decides whether a pinned account is signed in from vendor output: the exit status of `claude auth status`, the JSON of `pi auth check`, and the provider column of `pi --list-models`.
`tests/fm-worker-account-live-e2e.test.sh` asks the real installed runners about synthetic roots that need no login and no network, under a throwaway `HOME`.
A Claude root whose `settings.json` names an `apiKeyHelper` reports `loggedIn: true`, a Pi root holding a stored API key reports `ready`, and a provider registered by an extension in the Pi root's `extensions/` answers `pi auth check` with `not_ready`/`provider_not_found` while `pi --list-models` lists it.
Each refusal is paired with the divergence it depends on: the same runner, given `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or the extension's key variable, answers signed in for the empty root, so the refusal proves the check's cleared environment.
Replacing `env -i` with `env` in the check makes the guard fail on the Claude refusal.

Verified 2026-09-22 on Claude Code 2.1.278 and pi 0.86.1 on Linux; pi-signed was not installed.

```sh
bash tests/fm-worker-account-live-e2e.test.sh
```

```
ok - claude 2.1.278 (Claude Code): the pin check accepts a signed-in root and refuses an empty one despite an ambient API key
ok - pi 0.86.1: the pin check reads auth check and the model listing, and refuses what only an ambient credential signs in
skip-runner: pi-signed is not installed, so its pin check was not exercised
# worker account live guard checked: claude pi
```

The guard submits no prompt and spends no tokens, so it runs by default wherever a runner is installed; rerun it after every Claude or Pi upgrade.

## Codex hook trust

Verified 2026-09-16 on codex-cli 0.151.0, macOS arm64, in a fresh linked worktree of this repository.

Codex gates hooks it has no persisted trust for behind an interactive modal.
A crewmate launch built by `bin/fm-spawn.sh` was driven under a real PTY and stopped there before the brief was ever submitted:

```text
Hooks need review
12 hooks are new or changed.
Hooks can run outside the sandbox after you trust them.
> 1. Review hooks
  2. Trust all and continue
  3. Continue without trusting (hooks won't run)
Press enter to confirm or esc to go back
```

The selection starts on "Review hooks", which is neither trusting nor declining, and Firstmate's key plane carries only Enter, Escape, and C-c with no arrow navigation, so the selection cannot be moved.
That count covers every hook Codex had no persisted trust for, drawn from both the machine's own `~/.codex/hooks.json` and this repository's tracked `.codex/hooks.json`.
Writing Codex's own trust store to pre-accept the modal would record an operator consent that was never given, so it is not an option either.

`codex --help` documents `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust` as "Run enabled hooks without requiring persisted hook trust for this invocation", which RUNS the untrusted hooks.
That is the opposite of what an unattended worker needs, so the control used is the hook feature flag:

```sh
codex features list | grep '^hooks'
codex --disable hooks features list | grep '^hooks'
codex --disable no_such_feature features list
```

```text
hooks                                    stable             true
hooks                                    stable             false
Error: Unknown feature flag: no_such_feature
```

The last arm is what makes the control safe to depend on: an unknown feature name is a hard error, so a release that renames or drops the flag fails the launch loudly instead of silently restoring the modal.

The same launch with the hook layer disabled reached the composer with no modal, answered the prompt, and fired the turn-end program that rides the launch rather than any hook:

```sh
codex --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox --disable hooks \
  -c "notify=[\"bash\",\"-c\",\"touch $TURNEND\"]" "Say ACK and stop."
```

```text
> Say ACK and stop.
- ACK, captain.
$ ls "$TURNEND"
<turn-end file present>
```

`tests/fm-codex-hook-layer-live-e2e.test.sh` is the command that refreshes this record.
It captures the launch `bin/fm-spawn.sh` actually builds, replays those exact flags against the installed Codex, and fails naming the harness and version if the hook layer comes back on.
It spends no model tokens, so it runs by default wherever Codex is installed.
The portable half, `tests/fm-spawn-dispatch-profile.test.sh`, pins the split the launch template makes: a crewmate launches hook-free while a secondmate, which runs a primary session on this repository's own project hooks, keeps them.

## Composer classification matrix

The shared composer classifier (`bin/fm-composer-lib.sh`, `fm_composer_classify_screen`) owns every composer shape fleet-wide; each backend contributes only a capture and a capability descriptor.
The live half of that guarantee was verified on 2026-08-10 from an already-trusted checkout at the branch's final validated head, against every installed harness then covered by the empty-composer matrix on tmux 3.6a, macOS arm64, on an isolated private socket, with no prompt submitted to any harness.
An earlier untrusted-worktree run left Claude, Grok, and Muse unverified because the guard treats first-launch trust dialogs as an unreadable-composer state and never confirms them; this trusted-checkout rerun supersedes those missing results.

```sh
FM_COMPOSER_MATRIX_LIVE=1 tests/fm-composer-matrix-live-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed output:

```text
ok - claude (2.1.227 (Claude Code)): real idle composer classifies empty
ok - codex (codex-cli 0.146.0): real idle composer classifies empty
ok - opencode (1.14.46): real idle composer classifies empty
ok - pi (0.84.0): real idle composer classifies empty
ok - grok (grok 1.0.0 (3cd0d0cbcebe)): real idle composer classifies empty
# harness absent, not verified here: kimi
ok - muse (Muse Code 0.1.0 (0.1.0-R708.1)): real idle composer classifies empty
ok - strict posture live: a blank shell row classifies unknown and injection defers
ok - zellij (zellij 0.44.0): unrelated pane change never confirms delivery (verdict: unknown)
ok - live composer-matrix guard verified 8 live surface(s)
```

All six installed harnesses' real idle composers reached a proven `empty` (Claude auto-updated to 2.1.227 between the audit and this rerun, so the shipped classifier is proven against the newer release as well), including Pi through the tmux foreground-process identity probe, Grok through the titled-bottom-border tolerance, and OpenCode through the left-bar shape; Codex and OpenCode first parked on vendor update-available modals that the strict classifier correctly refused until the guard's single non-submitting Escape dismissed them.
The strict blank-row posture held live (a blank shell row deferred injection), and a zellij pane changing for reasons unrelated to submission never confirmed a delivery, replacing the retired content-diff heuristic's false positive.
Kimi was not installed on the verification machine; its bordered shape is pinned by the portable byte-capture regressions in `tests/fm-composer-lib.test.sh`, which also carry the other five adapters' capability profiles for every harness under both a UTF-8 locale and `LC_ALL=C`.
This guard is the refresh command after an upgrade to any matrix-covered harness; rerun it and update the versions above rather than trusting this table across releases.
The 2026-08-23 steering-inbox doorbell run observed grok 1.0.5's idle composer classifying `unknown` (and sometimes pending-family), never `empty`.
Issue #3436's recorded idle capture reproduced the cause on 2026-09-14: Grok 1.0.5 renders the titled bottom border three columns wider than its aligned top and content rows, so the cursorless Herdr profile rejected the otherwise complete box as ambiguous.
The classifier now accepts only that exact three-column overhang (`FM_COMPOSER_GROK_TITLE_OVERHANG` in `bin/fm-composer-lib.sh`) carrying a typed `Grok <model> (<effort>)` title; the portable regressions feed the real capture through both the shared Herdr capability profile and `fm_backend_herdr_composer_state`, and prove idle is `empty`, typed content is `pending`, and an unrecognized oversized title remains `unknown`.
Grok was not installed on the verification machine for this 2026-09-14 change, so the live guard still owes a refresh against the current release rather than treating the portable capture as current live evidence; the three-column width is not live-verified and may need adjustment if Grok's title rendering changes or scales with title length.
This closes only #3436's idle-composer-misclassification symptom (Grok/Herdr composer read `unknown` instead of `empty`, blocking away-mode injection). The issue's second symptom - a leftover watcher never yielding and never being taken over or refused at AFK start - is unrelated to composer classification and is tracked separately in #2270, where #3436's reproduction serves as corroborating evidence.
Cursor is deliberately outside this cursor-anchored empty-composer matrix because its terminal cursor is parked outside the composer; tmux's Cursor-specific, process-identity-gated cursorless fallback is covered by the [Cursor Agent CLI](#cursor-agent-cli) section's separate live evidence and drift guard.

`zellij action dump-screen --pane-id <id> --ansi` was verified at zellij 0.44.0 to preserve ANSI styling (real Claude Code rendered inside a zellij pane dumped `ESC[m` `❯` U+00A0 for its idle composer row), which is the capability the zellij composer classifier reads.

### 2026-09-20 claude 2.1.236 statusLine footer through Herdr

Verified on 2026-09-20 on macOS arm64 (Darwin 25.6.0) against Claude Code 2.1.236 running as Firstmate workers in Herdr 0.8.0 panes, read through Herdr's ANSI capture with its exact capability descriptor (`styled=1`, `cursor=0`, `identity=1`, `rows=20`).
Claude 2.x draws its composer as a bare `❯` + U+00A0 row between two solid `─` rules, and this home's configured statusLine plus Claude's permission-mode hint render on the two rows directly below the closing rule.
The statusLine's first glyph is `→` (U+2192), which is Cursor's own prompt glyph, so the cursorless "bottom-most shape wins" rule selected the statusLine as a bare composer at `kind=bare first=18 last=19` within the 20-row tail, read the statusLine and the hint row as wrapped typed input, and answered `pending` on a composer holding nothing.
`fm_task_inbox_ring` (`bin/fm-task-inbox-lib.sh`) defers on exactly that verdict, and `bin/fm-watch.sh`'s re-ring calls the same function, so both the first doorbell and every retry were skipped and the worker never saw the steer.

The capture is a read-only `herdr pane read <pane> --source recent --format ansi` of five live worker panes; each 20-row tail is fed to the shared classifier with the descriptor above, resolving the lazy identity sentinel with the pane's real `claude<TAB>idle` identity:

```sh
herdr --session default pane read w83:p2 --source recent --lines 200 --format ansi > claude-2.1.236-idle-herdr.ansi
bash -c '. bin/fm-composer-lib.sh
  caps=$(printf "styled=1\ncursor=0\nidentity=1\nrows=20")
  cap=$(tail -n 20 claude-2.1.236-idle-herdr.ansi)
  v=$(fm_composer_classify_screen "$caps" "$cap")
  [ "$v" != need-identity ] || v=$(fm_composer_classify_screen "$caps" "$cap" "" "$(printf "claude\tidle")")
  printf "%s\n" "$v"'
```

Observed output across the five live panes before the fix and then after it, in pane order `w83:p2`, `w84:p2`, `w87:p2`, `w7R:p2`, `w7W:p2`:

```text
pending pending pending pending pending
empty   empty   empty   pending pending
```

Three of the five composers were genuinely empty and every one of them was refused; the two that stayed `pending` after the fix really did hold text, and the extracted content names it exactly (`<65;77;27M` and `<65;77;27M5;77;27M`, stray SGR mouse reports left in the composer by a click in the pane).
That extraction is the disconfirming measurement: before the fix the extracted "pending text" for an empty composer was the statusLine itself (`bloomandhuda26 git:(...)× | Opus 5 (1M context) | ctx [█░░░░░░] 15% | ... ⏵⏵ bypass permissions on (shift+tab to cycle) · ← 1 agent`), never anything from the composer row, so the pane was never the disagreement - the judgement of it was.
The same panes accepted `fm_backend_send_text_submit` at the same moment because herdr's submit core confirms delivery from native `agent get` state and only falls back to the composer verdict when that state stays idle, so the working path never asked the question the doorbell's pre-send gate asks.

`test_matrix_claude_arrow_statusline_footer` in `tests/fm-composer-lib.test.sh` carries the shape with its statusLine and hint rows, and pins the two protections the fix must not remove: real unsubmitted text in that same composer under that same statusLine still reads `pending`, and so does the stray mouse report.
`test_composer_footer_demotion_needs_a_proven_pair` pins the three bounds of the demotion - a blank row ends the footer zone, a separator pair that closed over no agent-glyph row demotes nothing, and Cursor's half-block-bounded `→` composer is untouched - plus the strict posture that an unanchored statusLine row alone never proves an empty composer.
The footer zone is a property of any envelope a glyph row inside it proves, not of the separator pair specifically, so the same statusLine footer under claude's BORDERED composer (the shape a wide pane renders) is demoted identically; `test_composer_footer_zone_is_shape_independent` carries that box shape, asserts the statusLine is never the extracted composer content, and pins both counterweights - typed text inside that same box under that same footer still reads `pending`, and codex's startup banner, which holds no glyph row and therefore proves nothing, still yields to the live bare row drawn contiguously below it.

The demotion is deliberately ASYMMETRIC: `empty` is the only verdict that authorizes `fm-send` to type into a pane, so the rule may move a verdict toward refusing but never toward `empty`.
It therefore counts a footer zone only when every row in it is demonstrably furniture - omp's status row, a braille animation row, claude's permission-mode hint row (`⏵⏵ bypass permissions on`), or a row leading with an agent glyph OTHER than the one that proved the envelope, which is what the `→` statusLine is on a `❯` claude pane.
A run containing unclaimed activity (`Working on request...`, `→ ran npm test (3 failures)`) is not furniture in either row order and keeps invalidating the envelope above it, and a row leading with the SAME glyph the envelope was proven by (`❯ my typed draft`) is a live composer that keeps winning, so a visible draft is never overwritten.
`test_composer_footer_zone_refuses_rather_than_allows` pins both directions on the bordered-box and separator-pair shapes.

Coverage is the bordered box and the separator pair, the two shapes claude 2.x renders. The opencode left bar is wired into the same rule but is **unexercised**: every left-bar row this repo records leads with plain text, and opencode's own prompt character is `>`, a shell glyph deliberately outside the agent set, so no opencode shape recorded here can prove a left-bar envelope or open a footer zone beneath one.

The live refresh for this entry is the cursorless arm added to the composer-matrix guard, which re-reads each harness's already-proven-idle pane the way every non-tmux backend reads it and fails naming the harness and version when that read is `pending`:

```sh
FM_COMPOSER_MATRIX_LIVE=1 tests/fm-composer-matrix-live-e2e.test.sh
```

On 2026-09-20 that guard could not reach its new arm for either installed harness, and the same failures reproduce on the unmodified library: bare `claude` 2.1.236 opens the session picker rather than a session, and the guard's mid-budget Escape then quits it, while codex-cli 0.147.0 parks on a hooks-trust modal the guard correctly refuses to confirm.
The Herdr captures above are therefore this entry's live evidence, and the guard's claude arm owes a separate repair before it can refresh it.

### 2026-09-15 codex-cli 0.154.0 idle starfield and status footer through Herdr

Verified on 2026-09-15 on macOS arm64 (Darwin 25.5.0) against codex-cli 0.154.0 (model gpt-6-astra, fast mode) running as a Codex second mate inside a Herdr pane, read through Herdr's ANSI capture with its exact capability descriptor (`styled=1`, `cursor=0`, `identity=1`, `rows=20`).
Idle, codex 0.154 animates a braille starfield on the row above its bold `›` prompt row, on the `›` row behind the SGR-2 dim `Ask Codex to do anything` placeholder, and on the row below it, then draws a status footer reading `gpt-6-astra high fast · ~/Projects/purser · Launch Purser desk brief`.
The starfield cells are truecolor greys whose luminance runs from roughly 66 to 165, so the cells above the 128 ghost ceiling survive ghost stripping, and the footer is bright, non-blank, and carries no structural edge.

The capture is a read-only `herdr pane read <pane> --format ansi` of the live pane; its 20-row tail is fed to the shared classifier with the descriptor above:

```sh
herdr pane read w4Z:p2 --format ansi > codex-0.154-idle-herdr.ansi
bash -c '. bin/fm-composer-lib.sh
  caps=$(printf "styled=1\ncursor=0\nidentity=1\nrows=20")
  fm_composer_classify_screen "$caps" "$(tail -n 20 codex-0.154-idle-herdr.ansi)"'
```

Observed output on the same capture before the fix (`bin/fm-composer-lib.sh` at b85e28b5) and then after it:

```text
pending
empty
```

Before the fix the bare `›` shape extended its wrap region over the two rows beneath the glyph (`kind=bare first=17 last=19` within the 20-row tail), read the surviving starfield cells and the footer as wrapped typed input, and answered `pending`.
The steering doorbell (`fm_task_inbox_ring` in `bin/fm-task-inbox-lib.sh`) defers on exactly that verdict, so every ring for the pane was recorded as skipped and the marked request was reported as a missed delivery.
After the fix, braille-only rows bound the wrap region (the status footer sits beneath the starfield row, so the region never reaches it), starfield cells behind the placeholder are stripped from the glyph row, and the same capture reads `empty` under the Herdr and Zellij styled profiles and with a tmux cursor on the glyph row, while a plain (`styled=0`) capture still reads `unknown`, never `pending`.
A second read-only capture of the same pane, taken during the fix with a bright starfield cell drawn between the `›` and the placeholder, read `pending` before and `empty` after as well.
`test_matrix_codex_idle_starfield_furniture` in `tests/fm-composer-lib.test.sh` carries both samples byte-for-byte, the divergence (the same screen with letters in place of the starfield reads `pending`), and the over-stripping negatives (wrapped typed input, braille mixed with text, a typed row with a middle dot, and the footer or a starfield row alone).

The live guard that refreshes this entry launches the installed codex idle in an isolated tmux server and asserts `empty` through both the cursor-anchored tmux read and the cursorless styled read Herdr and Zellij use, naming codex and `codex --version` on failure; it is default-on wherever codex and tmux are installed and spends no tokens:

```sh
tests/fm-composer-codex-idle-live-e2e.test.sh
```

The verification machine runs its fleet on Herdr and has no tmux installed, so on 2026-09-15 that guard reported `skip: live: tmux absent` there, and the Herdr capture above is this entry's live evidence.
The guard also notes whether the starfield and the placeholder were actually drawn during its read, because codex need not animate them under every model or mode; a refresh on a tmux host should record that note beside the verdict rather than assume the starfield was exercised.

## Steering-inbox doorbell

The steering channel's one behavioral assumption - a real worker agent follows the constant self-describing doorbell line (list the inbox, read and act on its records in numeric order, then `mv` each into `handled/`) - was verified on 2026-08-23 against every installed verified harness, on tmux 3.6a, macOS arm64, on an isolated private socket, driving the REAL `bin/fm-send.sh` end to end (durable record plus doorbell, with one mid-wait re-ring playing the watcher's role).

```sh
FM_SEND_INBOX_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-send-inbox-doorbell-live-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed output (combined across the full run and the grok rerun after the advisory-skip narrowing landed):

```text
ok - claude (2.1.241 (Claude Code)): the doorbell reached a real worker, which acted and acked with the mv
ok - codex (codex-cli 0.147.0): the doorbell reached a real worker, which acted and acked with the mv
ok - opencode (1.18.21): the doorbell reached a real worker, which acted and acked with the mv
ok - pi (0.84.1): the doorbell reached a real worker, which acted and acked with the mv
# grok (grok 1.0.5 (5115b46bc909) [stable]): idle composer never classified empty; proceeding as production does (advisory check skips only on pending)
ok - grok (grok 1.0.5 (5115b46bc909) [stable]): the doorbell reached a real worker, which acted and acked with the mv
# harness absent, not verified here: kimi
ok - muse (Muse Code 0.2.1 (0.2.1-R1215.1)): the doorbell reached a real worker, which acted and acked with the mv
```

All six installed harnesses honored the doorbell contract with real model turns: each listed the inbox named by the doorbell, read its record, executed the instruction inside it, and acknowledged with the atomic `mv`.
Two findings from the run shaped the shipped behavior: an OpenCode vendor update modal swallowed the first doorbell and the single re-ring recovered it, which is exactly the watcher ladder's job; and grok 1.0.5's idle composer never classifies `empty` (a classifier drift owned by the [Composer classification matrix](#composer-classification-matrix) guard, whose refresh for grok 1.0.5 is still owed), which motivated the ring's advisory pre-check not to skip on ambiguity - a doorbell into an ambiguous composer is a recoverable constant line, while skipping on ambiguity would starve steering for any harness the classifier cannot positively identify.
The current pending-composer ring contract is owned by `bin/fm-task-inbox-lib.sh`.
Kimi was not installed on the verification machine; its receive path is the same one-line-plus-shell contract, and the portable ladder and enqueue regressions in `tests/fm-task-inbox.test.sh` and `tests/fm-send-inbox.test.sh` cover every harness-independent half.
This guard is the refresh command after any harness upgrade; it spends a small number of real tokens per installed harness, reports an absent harness explicitly, and refuses a run that verified nothing.

## Gemini

The Gemini crewmate adapter was verified on 2026-09-04 with gemini-cli 0.58.0 on Linux, Node v24.20.0, tmux 3.4.
Every check below ran in throwaway scratch worktrees against the real CLI; no task worktree was used and no agent was left running.
The credential was supplied only through the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable and its value appears nowhere in this record.

### Trust options are not equivalent

The refusal an untrusted launch produces, and its headless exit status:

```sh
gemini -p 'say OK'; echo "rc=$?"
```

```text
Gemini CLI is not running in a trusted directory. To proceed, either use `--skip-trust`, set the `GEMINI_CLI_TRUST_WORKSPACE=true` environment variable, or trust this directory in interactive mode.
rc=55
```

Both documented options clear that refusal, but only one loads project configuration.
The A/B below ran twice in ONE worktree carrying a project `AfterAgent` hook, with the same config home and the same prompt, changing only the trust mechanism:

```text
--skip-trust                 project-hook-fired=NO   untrusted-warnings=0   turn=✦ ECHO
TRUST_WORKSPACE=true         project-hook-fired=YES  untrusted-warnings=0   turn=✦ FOXTROT
```

`gemini skills list` names the cause directly in the untrusted case:

```text
Skipping project agents due to untrusted folder. To enable, ensure that the project root is trusted.
Project hooks disabled because the folder is not trusted.
```

This is why `bin/fm-spawn.sh` launches with `GEMINI_CLI_TRUST_WORKSPACE=true` and why `--skip-trust` must not be substituted for it.

### Busy signal

A full turn was captured every two seconds. The status row above the separator carries the one ASCII token, and the phase text beside it is model-generated:

```text
busy_1 | 1 |  ⠸ Thinking... (esc to cancel, 1s)
busy_5 | 1 |  ⠸ Begin Counting Methodically (esc to cancel, 9s)
busy_6 | 1 |  ⠇ Continue Enumerating Concepts (esc to cancel, 11s)
busy_7 | 0 |
busy_12 | 0 |
```

The idle capture taken before the prompt also contained no `(esc to cancel,`.
Because the phase text varies per turn and the spinner is braille, neither is usable; `(esc to cancel,` is the only stable rendered token, and the adapter uses the semantic hooks below as its actual state source.

### Hook lifecycle

`BeforeAgent`, `AfterAgent`, `SessionStart`, and `SessionEnd` were registered on one probe that appends its event name, then driven through a normal turn, an Escape interrupt, and `/quit`:

```text
--- after startup ---   SessionStart
--- mid-turn ---        SessionStart, BeforeAgent
--- after INTERRUPT --- SessionStart, BeforeAgent, AfterAgent
--- after /quit ---     SessionStart, BeforeAgent, AfterAgent, SessionEnd, SessionEnd
```

Two facts the adapter depends on come from that run: `AfterAgent` closes a turn that was CANCELLED, not only one that completed, and `SessionEnd` fired TWICE for a single `/quit`, so the repeated idle event must be harmless.
The `AfterAgent` payload carried the worktree as `cwd`, which is what binds a hook to its task:

```text
keys: ['cwd', 'hook_event_name', 'prompt', 'prompt_response', 'session_id', 'stop_hook_active', 'timestamp', 'transcript_path']
hook_event_name = AfterAgent
stop_hook_active = False
prompt = 'Say the single word CEDAR and stop.'
```

On the cancelled turn the same payload carried `prompt_response = '[no response text]'`.

### Autonomous end-to-end worker

One throwaway worker was launched exactly as the spawn launches one - positional brief, `-y`, workspace trust - and observed from start to idle:

```text
t=5s   (esc to cancel, 2s)
t=30s  busy marker present
idle at ~34s, busy marker count 0
worker-output.txt: DELIVERED
turn-end hook fires: 1
```

Its pane showed `✓ WriteFile worker-output.txt → Accepted (+1, -0)` with no approval gate, confirming `-y` runs unattended, and `Executing Hook: fm-turn-end` in the status row after the turn.

The adapter was then driven through the REAL `bin/fm-spawn.sh` and `bin/fm-control.sh` against a real Gemini pane in an isolated home:

```text
spawned gm-e2e harness=gemini kind=ship mode=no-mistakes yolo=off window=... worktree=...
hooks installed by spawn (state/<id>.gemini-settings.json): ['BeforeAgent', 'AfterAgent', 'SessionEnd']
t=4s   state: working · source: pane · harness busy (gemini-hook)
t=8s   state: working · source: pane · harness busy (gemini-hook)
after turn: v1 gen=... state=idle source=gemini-hook event=after-agent
e2e-output.txt: SEAWORTHY
interrupt-delivered gm-e2e harness=gemini backend=tmux verified=agent-alive cancel=unconfirmed
after interrupt: v1 gen=... state=idle source=gemini-hook event=after-agent
stopped gm-e2e harness=gemini backend=tmux endpoint=... worktree=...
```

The interrupt line is the one worth keeping: `AfterAgent` closed the record on a CANCELLED turn, which is why a gemini interrupt needs no `fm-interrupt` fallback event.
A single Escape on a long turn printed `ℹ Request cancelled.`, dropped the busy token, and left the agent running; `/quit` then exited with status 0 and printed `To resume this session: gemini --resume <session-id>`, and resuming by that id restored the full transcript.

### Identity markers

Env var NAMES were read from a real Gemini tool process launched under a Claude primary; no value of `GEMINI_API_KEY` was read.

```text
GEMINI_CLI=[1]
AI_AGENT=[claude-code_2-1-260_agent]
TRUSTWS=[true]
CLAUDECODE=[1]
```

`GEMINI_CLI` is unset in the launching environment, so it is Gemini's own; `CLAUDECODE` is inherited, which is why `bin/fm-harness.sh` tests `GEMINI_CLI` first.
`AI_AGENT` carried the CLAUDE primary's value and is therefore an inherited launcher marker, never a Gemini identity.

Ancestry cannot substitute for the marker on this platform:

```sh
node -e 'const{execSync}=require("child_process");console.log(execSync("ps -o comm= -p "+process.pid).toString().trim())'
```

```text
MainThread
```

The shipped CLI is a node bundle, so its live process never presents as `node` and neither ancestry arm matches it.

The same shape breaks pane liveness, which the end-to-end run surfaced as a hard refusal rather than a silent wrong answer:

```text
error: task gm-e2e's endpoint reads 'ambiguous' rather than a positively classified state; refusing to send a lifecycle key into an unattributed endpoint
```

A live gemini pane's foreground group read `comm=MainThread` and `argv0=/home/<user>/.local/node/bin/node`, so `bin/fm-gemini-lib.sh` now identifies it from argv[1] instead.
After that change the same endpoint classified `alive` while the worker ran and `dead` once it exited, so the rule is not simply always positive.
`tests/fm-gemini-harness.test.sh` pins that boundary so it is not later documented away, and `tests/fm-busy-adapter-wiring.test.sh` drives the generated hooks through the real writer and classifier.

```sh
bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-gemini-harness.test.sh tests/fm-busy-adapter-wiring.test.sh
```

### Credential wedge and its blast radius

With no resolvable credential the pane wedges on `Enter Gemini API Key` rather than failing.
That dialog is a credential FIELD, so lifecycle text sent to a wedged pane is submitted into it and stored.
Observed after an ordinary exit was delivered to such a pane: a `~/.gemini/gemini-credentials.json` (mode 0600) appeared that had not existed before, and a later credential-less run stopped refusing cleanly and instead reached the API:

```text
before: rc=41  When using Gemini API, you must specify the GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable.
after : rc=1   API key not valid. Please pass a valid API key.  (API_KEY_INVALID)
```

Clearing that stored credential restored both behaviours:

```text
GEMINI_API_KEY=<from the operator's own store> gemini --skip-trust -p 'Reply with exactly the word NOVEMBER.'  ->  NOVEMBER  rc=0
env -u GEMINI_API_KEY gemini --skip-trust -p hi                                                              ->  rc=41
```

The adapter reference records the operational rule this produces: never drive lifecycle text into a gemini pane showing that dialog; treat it as a credential blocker and retire the endpoint instead.
The credential must also be present before the session-provider daemon starts, since a long-lived tmux or Herdr server hands panes the environment it was started with.

### Settings placement

Firstmate's hooks are NOT written into the worktree's `.gemini/settings.json`, because unlike Claude's `settings.local.json` that path is the project's own committed settings file.
They go to a firstmate-owned `state/<id>.gemini-settings.json` reached through `GEMINI_CLI_SYSTEM_SETTINGS_PATH`.
Two measurements support that choice.
Hooks from the system layer fired under `--skip-trust` in an untrusted folder, so the busy contract does not depend on the trust decision:

```text
=== events (UNTRUSTED workspace, --skip-trust) ===
BeforeAgent
AfterAgent
```

And hook arrays MERGE across layers rather than overriding, so a project's own hooks keep running alongside firstmate's:

```text
=== which AfterAgent hooks ran (trusted workspace, both layers define AfterAgent) ===
PROJECT
SYSTEM
```

A second end-to-end spawn against a project that already committed its own `.gemini/settings.json` confirmed the file was untouched, that `git status` reported only the worker's own new output file, and that teardown removed firstmate's settings file:

```text
t=4s   state: working · source: pane · harness busy (gemini-hook)
t=8s   state: working · source: pane · harness busy (gemini-hook)
after turn: state=idle source=gemini-hook event=after-agent
e2e2-output.txt: ANCHOR
project .gemini/settings.json: {"context":{"fileName":"GEMINI.md"}}   (unchanged)
interrupt-delivered gm2 harness=gemini backend=tmux verified=agent-alive cancel=unconfirmed
stopped gm2 harness=gemini backend=tmux
teardown gm2 complete; state/gm2.gemini-settings.json removed
```

### Not verified

Gemini as a PRIMARY or SECONDMATE runtime is unverified and is refused by `bin/fm-spawn.sh`: no wake protocol exists under `docs/supervision-protocols/` and no turn-end guard adapter was built or exercised.
No reasoning-effort axis was found; `gemini --help` on 0.58.0 exposes no effort, reasoning, or thinking flag, so the record-and-omit contract applies.

## Herdr

The compatibility floor is protocol 14.
The whole real-Herdr lane's latest active verification uses both Herdr 0.7.4 protocol 16 and Herdr 0.8.0 protocol 19 on macOS aarch64, while focused Herdr 0.7.5 protocol 17, earlier protocol-16, protocol-14, and 0.7.3 evidence is retained where it defines current behavior or fallbacks.
Protocol 17 keeps every protocol-16 feature gate satisfied; the event and workspace-move floors remain 16.
Default-on presentation projection has its own floor at Herdr 0.8.0, protocol 19, verified below.

Core read-only probes:

```sh
herdr --version
herdr status --json | jq -c '{client:.client.protocol,server:.server.protocol}'
herdr api schema --json | jq -c '.schemas.subscription_event["$defs"].SubscriptionEventKind.enum'
```

Observed protocol-16 compatibility shapes:

```text
herdr 0.7.5
{"client":17,"server":17}
["pane.output_matched","pane.agent_status_changed","pane.scroll_changed"]
```

The CLI matrix was checked directly:

| Guarantee | Command shape | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Explicit session routing | `herdr <verb> ... --session <name>` | Reached the named session even while another server was running. |
| Literal send | `herdr pane send-text <pane> <text> --session <name>` | Left text unsubmitted until Enter. |
| Keys | `herdr pane send-keys <pane> enter|escape|ctrl+c --session <name>` | Enter and Escape worked; Ctrl-C interrupted foreground work. |
| Capture | `herdr pane read <pane> --source recent --lines N` | Small N could return empty below viewport height; a 200-line request plus local trim was stable. |
| Viewport capture | `herdr pane read <pane> --source visible` | Verified on 2026-09-17 against Herdr 0.8.0 (protocol 19): `herdr pane read --help` documents `--source <SOURCE>` with `[possible values: visible, recent, recent-unwrapped, detection]`; `--source visible` exited 0 and returned 51 lines (the viewport) while `--source recent --lines 200` returned 200. This is the viewport-only read behind `fm_backend_herdr_visible_capture`, which Kimi's trust-dialog gate requires. |
| Native state | `herdr agent get <pane>` | Working and done transitions were visible on some harnesses; live Claude Code 2.1.236 on Herdr 0.8.0 kept `agent_status=idle` for an entire landed turn, including a multi-second tool call, so submit confirmation falls through to the shared composer verdict. Native `busy` remains positive activity evidence, while native `idle` cannot close a turn and the adapter's semantic lifecycle decides worker state. |
| Restart | guarded named-session stop then start | Workspace, tab, pane, and labels persisted; the agent process and registration did not. |
| Close | `herdr pane close <pane> --session <name>` | The exact one-pane task tab closed; closing a final tab could remove the workspace. |

All destructive verification used `bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh` with a non-default `fm-lab-` name and a byte-identical default-session tripwire.
No ambient `herdr server stop` command is a supported test operation.

### fm-remote server birth and login-keychain access

Measured 2026-09-09 on macOS 26 (Darwin 25.6.0) aarch64 with Claude Code 2.1.266 and Herdr 0.9.0, the guarantee behind `bin/fm-remote-herdr-guard.sh` and the doctor's `herdr-server` check: login-keychain access follows the audit session a process was born into, never the launch shape or the shell.

Same user, same `HOME`, same login keychain item, three births, probed with `launchctl managername`, `getaudit_addr` (a compiled probe), `security find-generic-password -a "$USER" -w -s "Claude Code-credentials"` (output withheld), and `claude auth status`:

| Birth | `managername` | audit session | `security ... -w` | `claude auth status` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gui/501` LaunchAgent, bare `ProgramArguments`, `launchctl bootstrap` + `kickstart -k` mid-session | Aqua | asid 100038 (the `gui/501` asid), `HAS_GRAPHIC_ACCESS HAS_TTY HAS_CONSOLE_ACCESS HAS_AUTHENTICATED` | exit 0 | `loggedIn: true` |
| `gui/501` LaunchAgent, `zsh -l -c 'exec ...'`, same reload | Aqua | asid 100038, same flags | exit 0 | `loggedIn: true` |
| `user/501` LaunchAgent (`LimitLoadToSessionType=Background`), same reload | Background | asid 100056, flags `0x0` | exit 36 `User interaction is not allowed.`, item metadata still readable | `loggedIn: false`, `authMethod: none` |

Claude Code 2.1.266 maps that exit 36 (and 44) to "no keychain data" and reads `~/.claude/.credentials.json` instead; with a stale file it prints `Failed to authenticate: OAuth session expired and could not be refreshed` (interactive: `Login expired · Please run /login`).

Candidate birth markers were read with `ps -Eww -o command= -p <pid>` for own-uid processes, noting that macOS hides the environment of Apple platform binaries such as `/bin/sleep` and that a herdr server is never one.

```text
launchd-born herdr server (child of launchd, gui/501):  XPC_SERVICE_NAME=org.nix-community.home.herdr-server  no SSH_*
SSH-born herdr server (child of `herdr --session fm-remote remote-client-bridge` under `sshd-session: user@notty`):  SSH_CLIENT=... SSH_CONNECTION=...  no XPC_SERVICE_NAME
```

`XPC_SERVICE_NAME` identifies a launchd label but does not identify its domain, because the Background `user/501` job also carried that variable while lacking keychain access.
The owner classifier therefore accepts that label only when `launchctl print gui/<uid>/<label>` identifies the owner pid or the label is loaded in `gui/<uid>` but not `user/<uid>`.
`XPC_SERVICE_NAME=0`, including a value inherited by a herdr live-handoff child, remains unknown.
`FM_REMOTE_JOB_ACTIVE=1` proves the Aqua worker only when `dev.firstmate.remote-job` is loaded in `gui/<uid>` but not `user/<uid>`.

The SSH-born row was read on the remote host whose `dev.firstmate.herdr.fm-remote` job showed `state = spawn scheduled`, `runs = 239`, `last exit code = 1` and a log repeating `error: herdr server is already running`: herdr's remote attach had started the session's server as its own child before the login session existed, and launchd's copy lost the socket on every retry.
`pgrep -f` did not list the herdr server's argv on macOS; `lsof -U -a -c herdr -F pn` named the socket owner.

A separate foreground-supervision check ran on 2026-09-09 on macOS 26 (Darwin 25.6.0) with Herdr 0.9.0 using the throwaway Aqua launch agent `dev.fm-rca.herdr-fg`.
Its `ProgramArguments` ran `/run/current-system/sw/bin/zsh -l -c "exec /etc/profiles/per-user/kunchen/bin/herdr server --session fm-lab-fg-90381-18985"`, with `KeepAlive={SuccessfulExit=false}` and `ThrottleInterval=10`, after `launchctl bootstrap gui/501 <plist>` and `launchctl kickstart -k gui/501/dev.fm-rca.herdr-fg`.
`launchctl print gui/501/dev.fm-rca.herdr-fg` reported `state = running` and `pid = 4806`.
`lsof -U -a -c herdr -F pn` named pid 4806 as the owner of `~/.config/herdr/sessions/fm-lab-fg-90381-18985/herdr.sock`.
`ps -o pid,ppid,command -p 4806` reported `4806 1 /etc/profiles/per-user/kunchen/bin/herdr server --session fm-lab-fg-90381-18985`, and its environment carried `XPC_SERVICE_NAME=dev.fm-rca.herdr-fg`.
No other herdr process existed for that session, and after 15 seconds the job remained running with pid 4806.
After a guarded `herdr session stop`, the job reported `state = not running` and `last exit code = 0`, and it stayed at rest through the throttle interval.
A second `launchctl kickstart -k gui/501/dev.fm-rca.herdr-fg` started pid 45574, which was also the new socket owner.
This proves that `herdr server` remains in the foreground as the launchd job, so the guard's final `exec` supplies the intended supervision and the earlier server that survived `launchctl bootout` was the unrelated SSH-bridge-born process.

`bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-remote-herdr-guard.test.sh` pins the resulting decision table against real marker-carrying processes, and `tests/fm-remote-doctor.test.sh` pins the doctor's verdicts on the same markers.

### Client selection

Measured 2026-09-08 on a macOS aarch64 host running a Herdr 0.9.0 server (protocol 22) for the `fm-remote` session while `~/.local/bin/herdr` still held the self-updated 0.8.2 client (protocol 20) ahead of the Nix-managed 0.9.0 client on the remote-job `PATH`.

```sh
~/.local/bin/herdr --version
~/.local/bin/herdr pane get wCY:p2 --session fm-remote; echo "rc=$?"
~/.local/bin/herdr status --json --session fm-remote | jq -c '{c:.client.protocol,s:{running:.server.running,protocol:.server.protocol,compatible:.server.compatible}}'
herdr status --json --session fm-remote | jq -c '{c:.client.protocol,s:{running:.server.running,protocol:.server.protocol,compatible:.server.compatible}}'
```

```text
herdr 0.8.2
{"id":"cli:pane:get","error":{"code":"protocol_mismatch","message":"client protocol 20 is older than server protocol 22; upgrade the Herdr client before using this command"}}
rc=1
{"c":20,"s":{"running":true,"protocol":22,"compatible":false}}
{"c":22,"s":{"running":true,"protocol":22,"compatible":true}}
```

The refusal is a JSON error on stderr with exit 1 and empty stdout, and both client generations report `.server.compatible` and `.server.protocol` per named session, which is what the selection in `bin/backends/herdr.sh` reads.
`tests/fm-backend-herdr.test.sh` pins the bypass, same-process same-session caching, cross-session isolation, forced reselection, and both status shapes against fakes; `tests/fm-backend-herdr-smoke.test.sh` refreshes the real status normalization against the installed binary's running lab server.

### Submit confirmation

Measured 2026-08-19 against Herdr 0.8.0 and Claude Code 2.1.236 in an isolated `fm-lab-` session.

`herdr agent get` reported `agent_status=idle` on every sample across a landed one-word turn and an 8-second `sleep` tool call, while the pane rendered `Pontificating…` then `Sock-hopping… (11s · ↓ 234 tokens)`.
`fm_backend_herdr_send_text_submit` therefore cannot treat native idle as proof of a swallow.
The portable regressions in `tests/fm-backend-herdr.test.sh` and `tests/fm-composer-lib.test.sh` pin the verdicts: native idle plus a cleared composer is delivery, proven pending plus idle is a swallow, and proven pending plus a generating busy signal is a queued Enter.
Refresh the live Claude proof with:

```sh
FM_HERDR_SUBMIT_CONFIRM_LIVE=1 tests/fm-herdr-submit-confirm-live-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed 2026-08-19:

```text
ok - live Herdr submit confirm: Claude Code (2.1.236 (Claude Code)) on herdr 0.8.0 reports empty for a landed idle steer
```

### Prune and respawn

The real label-collision reproduction is owned by:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-prune-safety-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantee: a pre-existing captain-owned workspace with a seed-shaped tab was adopted for routing but its tab was never eligible for prune because the current create call did not return that seed id.

Restart-husk replacement is owned by:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-respawn-idem-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantee: a restored no-agent tab was replaced create-before-close, while a registered live agent caused refusal.

### Launcher workspace placement

Herdr exports its pane identity into every process it manages, checked on 2026-07-30 against Herdr 0.7.5 protocol 17 inside a guarded lab pane:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh
"$HERDR_LAB_HELPER" run "$LAB" pane run "$PANE" "sh -c 'env | grep ^HERDR | sort > /tmp/env.txt'"
```

```text
HERDR_ENV=1
HERDR_PANE_ID=w1:p1
HERDR_SESSION=fm-lab-fm-herdr-env-pro-65961-25535
HERDR_SOCKET_PATH=/Users/kunchen/.config/herdr/sessions/fm-lab-fm-herdr-env-pro-65961-25535/herdr.sock
HERDR_TAB_ID=w1:t1
HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID=w1
```

This complete injection shape is verified only for Herdr 0.7.5.
Firstmate requires both `HERDR_PANE_ID` and `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH` before accepting claimed launcher ancestry.

`pane get` reports the pane's current owning tab and workspace, which is what placement resolves from; the injected `HERDR_TAB_ID` and `HERDR_WORKSPACE_ID` are creation-time snapshots and are not read as current identity:

```sh
"$HERDR_LAB_HELPER" run "$LAB" pane get w1:p1 | jq -c '.result.pane | {pane_id,tab_id,workspace_id}'
```

```text
{"pane_id":"w1:p1","tab_id":"w1:t1","workspace_id":"w1"}
```

Placement is owned by:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-launcher-workspace-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantees on 2026-07-30 against Herdr 0.7.5 protocol 17:

```text
ok - real herdr E2E: with one 'firstmate' workspace and no herdr parent, a crewmate still lands in this home's own workspace without stealing focus
ok - real herdr E2E: the normal unique-label path is unchanged when the launcher's own pane identifies the workspace
ok - real herdr E2E: presentation spaces still create the isolated child workspace and bind it under the launcher's exact parent, without stealing focus
ok - real herdr E2E: with two 'firstmate' workspaces, a worker spawned from inside the second one lands in that exact workspace
ok - real herdr E2E: the duplicate-labeled sibling workspace is left entirely untouched and focus is preserved
ok - real herdr E2E: with a duplicated home label, a projected worker still hangs off the launcher's exact workspace and the sibling stays untouched
ok - real herdr E2E: an ambiguous home label with no launcher identity refuses before any worker endpoint exists
ok - real herdr E2E: a launcher pane that no longer exists refuses before any worker endpoint exists
ok - real herdr E2E: a secondmate launching its own worker gets the same exact-workspace guarantee, and its same-labeled sibling is untouched
ok - real herdr E2E: a --secondmate launch still stands up that secondmate's own workspace instead of inheriting the launcher's
ok - real herdr E2E: teardown closes only the worker's own pane and leaves the launcher, its workspace, and the same-labeled sibling intact
```

That suite's headline case runs `bin/fm-spawn.sh` inside a real Herdr pane, so the parent identity comes from Herdr's own injection rather than a composed environment.
Cross-session and contradictory bindings are covered deterministically in `tests/fm-backend-herdr.test.sh`, which can script a second server's socket without provisioning one.

### Per-home and presentation topology

Per-home behavior is owned by:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-workspace-per-home-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantee: the primary and secondmate used distinct home workspaces, a child launched by the secondmate stayed in that secondmate workspace, list-live remained home-scoped, and exact cleanup did not affect sibling homes.

The complete projection suite ran on 2026-07-21 against Herdr 0.7.4 protocol 16:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-presentation-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantees included:

```text
ok - real Herdr lab: primary and two secondmate homes each own a top-level contiguous child block
ok - real Herdr lab: concurrent primary/A/B spawns stay session-locked with zero focus drift
ok - real Herdr lab: session lock contention from a secondmate home falls back flat with no journal
ok - real Herdr lab: legacy projection labels and flat secondmate tabs are left unmigrated
ok - real Herdr lab: multi-home exact-pane teardowns restore captain focus without workspace close authority
ok - real Herdr lab validation completed on Herdr 0.7.4 with the default-session tripwire intact
```

The suite also covers lost or failed move responses, restart husks, missing and duplicate tokens, manual renames, concurrent cleanup, and exact focus restoration.

The mandatory projection suite ran again on 2026-07-24 against Herdr 0.7.5 protocol 16:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-presentation-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed restart-reclaim guarantees:

```text
ok - real Herdr lab: Hi Bit and Wheelhouse-style same-identity restarts reclaim one nested space with exact focus and idempotence
ok - real Herdr lab: secondmate restart binding and reclaim stay isolated to the exact child home and parent
ok - real Herdr lab: concurrent cross-home recoveries replace exact husks under one session lock with no focus drift
ok - real Herdr lab: missing, renamed, and duplicate tokens trigger zero destructive or adoptive calls, and live duplicate risk refuses launch
ok - real Herdr lab validation completed on Herdr 0.7.5 with the default-session tripwire intact
```

The projection suite ran again on 2026-08-04 against Herdr 0.8.0 protocol 19 for the default-on flip, where an absent `config/herdr-presentation-spaces` enables the projection and the value `off` opts out; since 2026-08-05 an absent file enables the projection only at or above the 0.8.0 floor recorded under "Presentation version floor" below, and `on` is the explicit opt-in that survives the floor:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-presentation-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed default and opt-out guarantees:

```text
ok - real Herdr lab: an opted-out spawn retains the Stage 1 Herdr command sequence with zero ordering calls
ok - real Herdr lab: a home that configured nothing is projected by default
ok - real Herdr lab: the primary presentation setting inherits into real secondmate homes
ok - real Herdr lab validation completed on Herdr 0.8.0 with the default-session tripwire intact
```

The projected spawn in that run used the historical empty opt-in file, so a home that had already enabled the projection keeps it without any migration step.
One concurrent cross-home recovery case refused under contention on a loaded machine and passed on an immediate rerun; recovery-path presentation lock contention is a deliberate hard refusal rather than a flat fallback, which default-on now makes reachable from any Herdr home.
That run measured the default-on projection on Herdr 0.8.0 only, while the focus-flash regression below was last run on 0.7.5 before the flip, so neither run covered a defective release under default-on projection; the version floor and the focus-flash suite's Part C close that gap.

The restored-shell session-start cleanup ran on 2026-07-24 against Herdr 0.7.5 protocol 17:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-herdr-session-cleanup-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed guarantee: one exact home-local, journal-correlated, one-tab and one-pane childless idle shell was closed after restoration while the exact non-target focus and default fleet session remained unchanged, and a repeat run was a no-op.

### Workspace-removal focus safety

The focus-flash regression ran on 2026-08-05 against both Herdr 0.7.5 protocol 17 and Herdr 0.8.0 protocol 19 on macOS aarch64, with the 0.7.5 run using the pinned upstream release binary first on `PATH`:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-focus-flash-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed output on Herdr 0.7.5:

```text
ok - old path: the explicit last-pane close of a non-focused workspace stole focus (w3	w3:t1 -> w2	w2:t1)
ok - mitigation: every in-operation sample preserved exact focus while the doomed workspace was removed
ok - mitigation: no explicit close and no corrective focus were needed on the defective release
ok - fallback: a doomed pane holding a persistent child exhausts the proof and takes the plain explicit close
ok - fallback on a defective release: a bounded wrong-focus window of 4 samples was fully restored to the anchor
ok - version floor: herdr 0.7.5 protocol 17 remains conservatively below the floor with steal_live=1
ok - version floor: an unconfigured home falls back flat on herdr 0.7.5 and the explicit opt-in still projects
evidence: herdr=0.7.5 protocol=17 steal_live=1 floor_verdict=1 default-session-tripwire=armed
```

Observed output on Herdr 0.8.0:

```text
ok - old path note: this Herdr release preserves focus across the explicit close; continuing with outcome-only assertions
ok - mitigation: every in-operation sample preserved exact focus while the doomed workspace was removed
ok - fallback: a doomed pane holding a persistent child exhausts the proof and takes the plain explicit close
ok - fallback on a focus-preserving release: the plain explicit close preserved exact focus throughout
ok - version floor: herdr 0.8.0 protocol 19 is at or above the floor and preserves focus
ok - version floor: an unconfigured home stays projected on herdr 0.8.0 and the explicit opt-in agrees
evidence: herdr=0.8.0 protocol=19 steal_live=0 floor_verdict=0 default-session-tripwire=armed
```

The same guarded named-lab command passed on 2026-09-03 against Herdr 0.8.2 after this regression joined the required `real-herdr-gated` lane.
It reported `steal_live=0 floor_verdict=0 default-session-tripwire=armed`, with the fleet's default session unchanged before and after.

Part C is the case the suite could not reach before: a doomed pane whose shell holds a persistent background child fails the lone-idle-shell proof on every sample, so the plan takes the plain explicit close, in the geometry where the closing workspace's right neighbour is a spacer rather than the focused anchor.
On 0.7.5 that fallback exposed a bounded four-sample wrong-focus window and restored the anchor exactly; on 0.8.0 the same fallback exposed none, which is why default-on projection is floored at 0.8.0 rather than mitigated further below it.
The suite also cross-checks its own Part A measurement against the floor classifier on whatever release it runs, so a drifted protocol-to-release mapping fails there rather than silently gating on the wrong thing.

### Attached foreground viewer

A pseudo-terminal registers as a Herdr foreground client only when its window grid is non-zero.
`script` and a bare `pty.fork()` from a non-tty parent both start at 0x0, which is why PR #4131 could validate only the detached half of the teardown focus guard and left its four attached-client scenarios untested.
The guarded `viewer start` path fixes the pty at the proven 40-row by 120-column grid, sets that size on the master fd before the fork, and scrubs inherited `HERDR_*` variables, which makes the attached scenarios reachable from a headless runner.

Measured on 2026-09-11 against Herdr 0.9.0 protocol 22 on macOS 26.5.2 aarch64 with Python 3.14.6:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-herdr-attached-viewer-live-e2e.test.sh
```

```text
ok - attached viewer: a pty sized before the fork registers as a real Herdr foreground client
ok - attached viewer: a live client on the target tab refuses the close and keeps the pane
ok - attached viewer: focus moving onto the target between planning and mutation still blocks the close
ok - attached viewer: a close preserves the fresh non-target focus the viewer moved to
ok - attached viewer: the projection seeded-tab prune refuses while a live client watches it
ok - attached viewer: detaching releases the refusal, so the guard tracks the client and not the pointer
```

Both halves of the recipe are load-bearing, and each was measured by removing it from the helper and re-running the guard on the same host and release.
Dropping the `TIOCSWINSZ` call and dropping the environment scrub each left startup reporting `no_foreground_client`, followed by the guard failure:

```text
not ok - could not attach a real foreground Herdr viewer over a sized pty
```

Re-run this guard after every Herdr upgrade.
A release that changed the foreground-client contract, the window-grid requirement, or the nested-viewer refusal would fail here first, and the detached regressions would keep passing while saying nothing about it.

### Presentation version floor

Default-on presentation projection is floored at Herdr 0.8.0.
The floor's structural signal is the selected running server's protocol number, falling back to the client protocol only when that selected session positively reports no running server, and the release mapping was measured on 2026-08-05 by running each pinned upstream macOS aarch64 release asset's own `status --json` through the guarded lab helper:

| Release | Reported version | Protocol | Carries both upstream focus fixes | Floor verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| v0.7.3 | 0.7.3 | 16 | no | below |
| v0.7.4 | 0.7.4 | 16 | no | below |
| v0.7.5 | 0.7.5 | 17 | no | below |
| preview-2026-07-21-0f10e1453a7f | 0.7.5-preview.2026-07-21-0f10e1453a7f | 17 | no | below |
| preview-2026-07-29-44b3adb12552 | 0.7.5-preview.2026-07-29-44b3adb12552 | 18 | yes | below |
| preview-2026-08-04-d78e3d3b5126 | 0.8.0-preview.2026-08-04-d78e3d3b5126 | 19 | yes | above |
| v0.8.0 | 0.8.0 | 19 | yes | above |

No build lacking both fixes reaches protocol 19, and every pre-fix build tops out at 17, so protocol 19 is a safe structural expression of the 0.8.0 floor.
The one post-fix build below it is a preview that still reports a 0.7.5 version, so it is conservatively treated as below the floor, which costs a preview build its projection and never lets an unfixed build through.
The 2026-08-05 named-lab cross-version probe started a server from Herdr 0.7.5 and queried it with the installed 0.8.0 client; status reported client version 0.8.0 protocol 19, server version 0.7.5 protocol 17, server running true, and server compatible false.
That ordinary post-upgrade shape proves the running server owns the focus behavior, so the unconfigured default composes client and selected-server verdicts conservatively and rechecks after server ensure before publishing a journal or creating a workspace.

Refresh this table with the opt-in guard, which re-downloads the pinned assets, verifies their digests, and fails naming any release whose reported version, protocol, or verdict has moved:

```sh
FM_HERDR_VERSION_FLOOR_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-herdr-version-floor-live-e2e.test.sh
```

The classifier itself, the config preference it composes with, and the one-warning-per-release behavior are pinned portably with no Herdr installed:

```sh
tests/fm-backend-herdr.test.sh
```

Observed guarantees: every measured release classifies as the table records; either the protocol or the version signal alone carries an at-or-above verdict, and each divergent pair flips once the carrying signal is removed; client and running selected-session server verdicts compose conservatively, an unreadable server-running state and losing both release signals report indeterminate and fall back flat, the default is rechecked after server ensure before projection publication, an unconfigured home is projected only at or above the floor, an explicit `on`, including the historical empty opt-in file, is honored below it, and the below-floor warning is emitted once per home per detected release rather than once per spawn.

The whole real-Herdr lane was run on 2026-08-05 against both the CI-pinned Herdr 0.7.4 protocol 16, which is below the floor, and Herdr 0.8.0 protocol 19, which is at it:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh bin/fm-test-run.sh --lane real-herdr-gated
```

Both runs reported `family=real-herdr-gated count=11 failed=0`.
The projection suite's unconfigured-home case is release-aware rather than pinned to one outcome, so it proves the projected default on 0.8.0 and the flat fallback with its naming warning on 0.7.4:

```text
ok - real Herdr lab: a home that configured nothing is projected by default on herdr 0.8.0
ok - real Herdr lab: a home that configured nothing falls back flat on below-floor herdr 0.7.4 with one naming warning
```

Every other case in that suite uses an explicit opt-in or opt-out, so the floor leaves them unchanged on both releases.

Direct lab probes on 2026-07-28 established the removal rules the emptying-close plan relies on, each verified with `workspace list` focus reads around one mutation in a guarded `fm-lab-` session:

- An explicit `pane close` that emptied a non-focused workspace moved focus off the focused workspace in both before-focus and after-focus geometries.
- Ending a workspace's lone shell preserved the focused workspace exactly when the dying workspace sat behind it or the focused workspace was last, and moved focus to the focused workspace's right neighbor otherwise.
- The production focus-preserving close in the dangerous geometry repositioned the doomed workspace, ended its proved shell, and left every concurrent focus sample on the exact anchor with no corrective `tab focus` issued.

Two real-hardware conditions were required for the pane-death path to engage and are now encoded in the adapter and its unit fixtures: BSD `ps` reports a login shell's `comm` as `-zsh`, and an idle shell transiently hosts a prompt helper (starship) as a second foreground process immediately after a `workspace.move` relayout, which the bounded settle window absorbs.

The rules match the v0.7.5 tag source (`close_selected_workspace` reassigns focus from the closing workspace's index; `handle_pane_died` only clamps the stale focused index), and the upstream default branch resolves both paths by workspace id (PR #1877, commit `165dca45`, for the explicit close; PR #1912, commit `a979916`, for pane death), so the plan degrades to a harmless reorder-then-remove once a release carries them.

The full projection and restored-shell suites were re-run on 2026-07-28 on Herdr 0.7.5 with the updated close path; the presentation suite completed with `real Herdr lab validation completed on Herdr 0.7.5 with the default-session tripwire intact`, and the restored-shell cleanup guarantee above was unchanged.

The teardown-level record-retention gate was verified on 2026-07-28 with metadata fixtures and a live contending lock holder:

```sh
tests/fm-teardown.test.sh
tests/fm-backend-herdr.test.sh
```

Observed guarantees: a contended presentation lock refused the teardown before the isolated copy was returned, with the task branch, every durable record, and the endpoint intact and no pane close attempted; the retry after the contention cleared returned the copy, closed the pane under the lock, and removed the records; an unknown structured-presence result after an attempted projected close retained the journal and every record with a nonzero exit; and every presence-gate mode accepted only a structured not-found as gone.

The same fixtures verified three further boundaries on 2026-07-29: missing or malformed endpoint identity and an unparseable pane presence refused record removal with everything retained; the SIGKILL escalation re-read the exact pane's process information and refused to signal when a different shell pid owned the pane, falling back to the plain close with the original process untouched; and a reposition whose removal then failed on every path restored the exact original workspace order through a second verified move and reported the close as failed.

The teardown fixture was re-run on 2026-07-31 after extending the same fail-closed boundary through forced secondmate cleanup, including recursive cleanup of a nested secondmate whose Herdr grandchild close remains unconfirmed.

Observed output:

```text
ok - forced secondmate teardown preflights every Herdr child before cleanup mutation
ok - forced secondmate teardown retains Herdr child identity until exact pane disappearance
ok - forced teardown retains a nested secondmate home and its grandchild's Herdr identity when the grandchild close is unconfirmed
```

### Composer and operational input

Real captures verified these active distinctions:

- Claude and Codex use bare `❯` and `›` agent composers.
- Pi uses content between complete separator rows and requires exact native Pi identity.
- Dim or faint suggestion text is ghost content, while normally styled text is pending input.
- Grok dark truecolor placeholders are ghost content, while bright truecolor typed input remains pending.
- A bare shell prompt has no safe agent-composer container and is unknown.
- Codex 0.154's idle braille starfield rows are composer furniture, with the dated Herdr evidence and refresh command in [Composer classification matrix](#composer-classification-matrix).

`tests/fm-composer-ghost.test.sh`, `tests/fm-composer-lib.test.sh`, and the Herdr composer cases pin the exact captured ANSI bytes.
The U+2063 operational and routed-request separators were exercised through a real Pi-on-Herdr path; the byte-exact active regression is:

```sh
FM_SEND_MARKER_HERDR_E2E=1 \
  tests/fm-send-secondmate-marker-herdr-e2e.test.sh
```

### Native blocked event

The protocol-16 event path was measured on 2026-07-11 with Herdr 0.7.3 and Python 3.13:

```sh
HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-backend-herdr-eventwait-smoke.test.sh
```

Observed output:

```text
ok - real herdr: events.subscribe capability gate passes
ok - real herdr: a driven idle->blocked transition returns the blocked record in 0.129s
ok - real herdr: the watcher fast-path enqueues a stale wake naming the task window
```

Polling remained active and is covered as the fallback for capability, connect, subscribe, and repeated reader failure.

### Agent lifecycle control

Herdr is one of the two backends whose recovery-grade agent-state classifier the control plane may trust ([agent-control.md](../agent-control.md)), so its lifecycle gating is measured against the real binary; reverified 2026-08-08 on Herdr 0.8.0, and first measured 2026-08-02 on Herdr 0.7.5 with identical results:

```sh
tests/fm-control-herdr-smoke.test.sh
```

Observed output, refreshed 2026-09-10 on Herdr 0.9.0 after the stale-registration fix (the two stale-registration lines are recorded under "Stale agent registration" below):

```text
ok - real herdr: exit on a pane with no registered agent is idempotent success
ok - real herdr 0.9.0: a gone session reads recoverable while a live pane and a malformed target do not
ok - real herdr: a drifted agent-free shell returns to its worktree and reuses the same endpoint
ok - real herdr: interrupt refuses when herdr's own agent registry reports no agent
ok - real herdr: interrupt delivers the harness's key and proves the agent survived it
ok - real herdr: no control verb removed the endpoint or the task's local copy
ok - real herdr 0.9.0: a registration Herdr keeps after its agent exits reads stale-agent and recovers as dead
ok - real herdr: exit on a pane with a stale registration is idempotent success
ok - real herdr: a stale registration no longer blocks relaunch, and the endpoint and local copy survive
ok - real herdr: an agent that does not stop fails closed instead of being reported as stopped
```

The registry read through `herdr pane report-agent` is the same source `fm_backend_herdr_agent_state` classifies, and since 2026-09-10 that registration counts as an agent only while `pane process-info` shows a harness process behind it, so the guard backs the registration with a real process named like a harness (a symlink to `sleep`) and then stops that process, with no real harness launched.
That command is the guard that refreshes this record; run it after every Herdr upgrade rather than trusting the version above.

For Pi on Herdr 0.9.0, `herdr agent get` reflects whether the agent process remains live; its registration does not persist merely because the pane and parent shell do.
A Pi launched as a child of the pane shell (not via `exec`) that then `/quit`s or is SIGKILL'd leaves the pane and shell in place, and `agent get` returns `agent_not_found`.
A sibling live idle Pi stays `agent=pi` with `agent_status=idle`.
`fm_backend_herdr_pane_agent_state` maps that `agent_not_found` leftover shell to `no-agent` and `fm_backend_herdr_agent_state` maps it to `dead` (relaunch-allowed), while the live idle pane stays `alive`.
`herdr pane get` `.agent_status` can still read `idle` after the occupant is gone; liveness is `agent get`, never that pane field.

```sh
tests/fm-backend-herdr-agent-exit-shell-e2e.test.sh
```

Refresh that live pair after every Herdr upgrade. Observed 2026-09-10 on Herdr 0.9.0 / protocol 22 with Pi 0.82.0 in an isolated `fm-lab-` session:

```text
ok - agent get distinguishes leftover-shell (dead/no-agent) from live idle Pi
ok - pane get agent_status lag cannot keep an exited occupant classified alive
```

### Endpoint recovery classification

Measured 2026-09-10 on macOS aarch64 against Herdr 0.9.0 (protocol 22) in an isolated `fm-lab-` session.

An endpoint recorded in a session whose server is not running cannot be read by any operational call, and `status` is the one command that answers with a body instead of refusing:

```sh
herdr pane get w1:p2 --session fm-lab-never-started
herdr status --json --session fm-lab-never-started | jq -c "{running: .server.running, status: .server.status}"
```

```text
{"id":"cli:pane:get","error":{"code":"server_not_running","message":"no herdr server is running at /Users/kunchen/.config/herdr/sessions/fm-lab-never-started/herdr.sock; run `herdr session attach fm-lab-never-started` to start or attach it"}}
{"running":false,"status":"not_running"}
```

`fm_backend_herdr_agent_state` therefore settles an uninterpretable pane read with `.server.running` rather than with the `server_not_running` error code, which keeps the verdict working across the supported range: the field is present on 0.8.2 protocol 20 and 0.9.0 protocol 22 alike (measured in "Client selection" above), while the code is not.
Only that recovery-grade read is widened; the husk classifier under it stays strict, because it licenses closing panes.
Observed in the lab, in one run:

```text
live agent-free pane                 dead
endpoint in a session with no server missing
malformed target                     unreadable
```

The same run drove `bin/fm-spawn.sh --relaunch` against a real Herdr pane whose shell had been moved outside its recorded worktree: the shell was told once to return, ended in the recorded worktree, and the replacement was launched into the SAME pane, leaving one task tab.

Herdr 0.8.x is not installed on this host, so protocol-20 coverage is structural plus the adapter fixture exercising both response shapes; it is not a live result.
Refresh the live half, which fails naming the installed version, with:

```sh
tests/fm-control-herdr-smoke.test.sh
```

Observed 2026-09-10:

```text
ok - real herdr 0.9.0: a gone session reads recoverable while a live pane and a malformed target do not
ok - real herdr: a drifted agent-free shell returns to its worktree and reuses the same endpoint
```

`tests/fm-backend-herdr.test.sh` pins the logic portably by driving the two signals apart - the same failed pane read yields `missing` under a stopped server and `unreadable` under a running one - and asserts that the husk classifier still refuses on that identical read.
`tests/fm-control-herdr-smoke.test.sh` proves the Herdr-only drift recovery against a real binary in an isolated lab session.
`tests/fm-control-relaunch.test.sh` drives a tmux stub and proves that tmux retains its prior refusal without sending `cd` or any other input to the pane.
The Herdr refusal when a shell accepts the command but does not move is not exercised in this change.

### Stale agent registration

Measured 2026-09-10 on macOS aarch64 against Herdr 0.9.0 (protocol 22) and Pi 0.85.1 in an isolated `fm-lab-` session (upstream issue #4115, duplicates #3639, #3487, #2908, #3545).

Herdr keeps a Pi registration after the Pi process has exited to a shell when a nested interactive shell sits under the pane's top shell, which is the crew shape `treehouse get` leaves behind; a plain `/quit` directly under the top shell, and a `kill -9` of Pi, both released it on this version.
Reproduced in the lab with a nested `zsh` under the pane shell, then `pi` with no prompt, then `/quit`:

```sh
herdr pane run w1:p1 zsh --session "$LAB"; herdr pane run w1:p1 pi --session "$LAB"
herdr agent get w1:p1 --session "$LAB" | jq -c '.result.agent | {agent, agent_status}'
herdr pane process-info --pane w1:p1 --session "$LAB" | jq -c '.result.process_info | {shell_pid, fg: .foreground_process_group_id, procs: [.foreground_processes[] | {pid, name, argv0}]}'
herdr pane send-text w1:p1 '/quit' --session "$LAB"; herdr pane send-keys w1:p1 Enter --session "$LAB"
herdr agent get w1:p1 --session "$LAB" | jq -c '.result.agent | {agent, agent_status}'
herdr pane process-info --pane w1:p1 --session "$LAB" | jq -c '.result.process_info | {shell_pid, fg: .foreground_process_group_id, procs: [.foreground_processes[] | {pid, name, argv0}]}'
```

```text
{"agent":"pi","agent_status":"idle"}
{"shell_pid":87754,"fg":35952,"procs":[{"pid":35952,"name":"node","argv0":"pi"}]}
{"agent":"pi","agent_status":"idle"}
{"shell_pid":87754,"fg":35834,"procs":[{"pid":35834,"name":"zsh","argv0":"zsh"}]}
```

Before the fix `fm_backend_agent_state herdr` read that second state as `alive`, so `bin/fm-control.sh <id> relaunch` and `bin/fm-spawn.sh --relaunch` were refused for as long as the registration lived, which is hours.
The registration is still present after the wait, and Herdr's own `pane report-agent` leaves the same shape behind on any pane, which is what the lifecycle-control guard uses.

Two vendor facts the fix rests on, both read from the outputs above and from `fm_backend_herdr_pane_process_state`'s `pane process-info` parse:

- Pi's process presents with kernel name `node` and argv0 `pi` (its foreground group also carries Pi's child `node` helpers with argv0 such as `npm view ... version`), so a running Pi is attributed by argv[0] exactly as the tmux probe attributes it; a symlink named `claude` to `sleep` presents as name `sleep`, argv0 `claude`.
- Herdr creates the record with its own placeholder `agent_status` of `unknown` the moment it notices Pi, before Pi's extension reports `idle`; that transient reads `unknown` in the pane classifier as it always did, and only a lifecycle status is subject to the process-level proof.

Subcommand presence below the 0.9.0 measurement, checked 2026-09-10 on macOS aarch64 against the pinned upstream release clients fetched from `https://github.com/ogulcancelik/herdr/releases/download/v<version>/herdr-macos-aarch64`:

The command run against each client was `<client> pane --help`, which is client-side, session-independent, and opens no socket, and each printed the line:

```text
process-info  Show pane process information
```

This proves subcommand presence in the client only, not the server response shape, which is measured only on 0.9.0 above.

The live guard that refreshes this record runs by default wherever Herdr and Pi are installed, spends no model token, and fails naming both versions:

```sh
tests/fm-herdr-pi-stale-registration-live-e2e.test.sh
```

Observed 2026-09-10:

```text
# pi 0.85.1 under herdr 0.9.0: registered idle, foreground [{"name":"node","argv0":"node"},{"name":"node","argv0":"node"},{"name":"node","argv0":"rpiv-ask-user-question version"},{"name":"node","argv0":"npm view gentle-engram version"},{"name":"node","argv0":"pi"}]
ok - real herdr 0.9.0 + pi 0.85.1: a running registered pi classifies alive at process level
# herdr 0.9.0 kept the pi registration (idle) after /quit under a nested shell: the stale-registration branch is exercised
ok - real herdr 0.9.0 + pi 0.85.1: the registration left behind by a quit pi reads stale-agent and recovers as dead
```

`tests/fm-control-herdr-smoke.test.sh` proves the same shape through the control plane with no harness launched (the two `stale` lines under "Agent lifecycle control" above): a registration over a real agent-named process reads `alive`, stopping that process makes the pane read `stale-agent` and recover as `dead` while `agent get` still reports the record, `exit` then reports `already-stopped`, and `--relaunch` reuses the same endpoint with the local copy intact.
`tests/fm-backend-herdr.test.sh` pins the logic portably with canned `process-info` bodies over real processes, driving the signals apart: the identical shell-only foreground reads `stale-agent` for a childless shell and `live` when an agent-named process is still a descendant of that shell, a `working`, `done`, or `blocked` record over a shell-only pane reads the same as `idle`, an unreadable process view reads `unknown` and refuses husk closing, a transient prompt helper beside the shell settles into `stale-agent` on the next shell-only sample while a foreground that never settles within the bound still reads `live`, and `busy_state` verifies a `working` record before reporting busy.
`tests/fm-crew-state.test.sh` pins the recovery classifier: a stale registration over a shell-only pane reports agent gone rather than alive or unreachable, and a stale `working` record never reports the pane working.
A stale-registration pane is never a husk: create, reclaim, presentation recovery, and session cleanup keep refusing it, and only recovery reuses it.

### Away-mode transport

The away daemon is no longer launched on Pi; the away posture there is the record `bin/fm-afk-contract.sh` owns.
The Pi/Herdr away posture and return transport was verified on 2026-09-08 against a real Pi primary in an isolated Herdr lab session, Herdr 0.9.0 and Pi 0.82.0:

```sh
FM_AFK_PI_HERDR_E2E=1 HERDR_LAB_HELPER=bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh \
  tests/fm-afk-pi-herdr-return-e2e.test.sh
```

Relevant transport output:

```text
ok - real Pi primary: the away posture is recorded with no daemon launched
ok - real Pi/Herdr: nothing injects into the captain pane under the away posture
evidence: herdr=herdr 0.9.0 pi=0.82.0 target=fm-lab-fm-afk-pi-return-37189-7133:w1:p1 archived-records=2
```

Observed guarantees: `fm-afk-launch.sh start` refused on the Pi primary and the posture was recorded with no daemon pid, flag, or terminal; a pending real Pi draft was left untouched with nothing submitted into the captain pane; the unmarked return request was recognized as the return, rendered the brief health first, and opened the catch-up gate on the live blocker; resolving the blocker cleared the gate, and a clean re-entry and return left exactly one archived record per away window.
The current guard uses one `enter` call for each entry, so no separate confirmation sits between `/afk` and the durable record.
The current catch-up reporting boundary is pinned by `tests/fm-afk-return.test.sh` and the same live entry point: Bearings continues through a pending return catch-up, projects its posture as an action-free warning outside Captain's Call, and drops that warning after the gate clears, while an active away window still refuses.
The fixture captures submitted input through Pi's `input` extension hook, so the lab agent directory needs no provider credentials.
The daemon injection transport into a live composer keeps its coverage in `tests/fm-afk-inject-herdr-e2e.test.sh` for the harnesses that still run the daemon, and the dedicated Herdr daemon workspace topology is covered by `tests/fm-afk-launch.test.sh` and preserves the captain tab's pane count.

## Zellij

The current compatibility floor and latest verification are Zellij 0.44.0 with `jq` on macOS aarch64.
All real tests use a uniquely named session and `tests/zellij-test-safety.sh`; they never touch a session named `firstmate` or call all-session deletion.

| Guarantee | Command shape | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Headless session | `zellij attach -b <name>` without a TTY | Created a persistent background session and returned. |
| Session list | `zellij list-sessions --short --no-formatting` | Returned one plain name per line without starting a session. |
| Create tab | `zellij action new-tab --cwd <dir> --name <title>` | Returned a numeric tab id and focused the new tab when a client was attached. |
| Pane discovery | `zellij action list-panes --json` | Included terminal pane id, tab id, plugin flag, and top-level `pane_cwd`. |
| Literal send | `zellij action paste --pane-id <id> -- <text>` | Left text unsubmitted. |
| Keys | `send-keys --pane-id <id> Enter`, `Esc`, and one argument `Ctrl c` | All three shared operations worked. |
| Capture | `dump-screen --pane-id <id>` or `--full` | Worked with no attached client; no line-bound flag exists. |
| Styled capture | `dump-screen --pane-id <id> --ansi` | Preserved ANSI styling ("Composer classification matrix" above); feeds the zellij composer classifier. |
| Close | `close-tab-by-id <id>` | Removed the live task pane and tab together. |
| Failure exit | actions against missing targets | Returned exit 0, requiring structural preflight and output-shape validation. |

`pane_cwd` stayed frozen when a foreground subshell changed directory.
The marker-delimited `pwd` probe returned the live nested cwd and is covered by the real smoke.
The focus mitigation restored the previously active tab after `new-tab`, with the unavoidable narrow race documented in the operator guide.

```sh
tests/fm-backend-zellij.test.sh
tests/fm-backend-zellij-smoke.test.sh
```

The real lifecycle smoke proved spawn, metadata, nested-subshell worktree discovery, send, capture, unlanded-work refusal, approved local landing, exact tab cleanup, and session cleanup without retaining task-specific ids or branch names here.

## Orca

Real readiness was verified against `/usr/local/bin/orca` with `/Applications/Orca.app` bundle version 1.4.116.

```sh
orca status --json
```

Observed fields:

```text
result.runtime.reachable=true
result.runtime.state=ready
```

`orca terminal create --json` returned `result.terminal.handle`.
`orca worktree create` returned `result.worktree.id` and `result.worktree.path`.
Speculative bare ids and nested terminal fields were deliberately rejected.

```sh
tests/fm-backend-orca.test.sh
tests/fm-backend.test.sh
tests/fm-bootstrap.test.sh
```

The fake-Orca suite covers readiness, registration, create response parsing, metadata routing, popup-safe submit, and path-matched release refusal.

## cmux

The current compatibility floor is cmux 0.64, and the active live evidence uses 0.64.17 build 97 on macOS aarch64.
Real tests use only exact `fm-test-` workspaces guarded by `tests/cmux-test-safety.sh` and never quit or relaunch the captain's app.

```sh
cmux version
cmux ping
```

Observed version:

```text
cmux 0.64.17 (97) [9ed29d81a]
```

Source and live checks established the five control modes:

- `off` starts no listener.
- `cmuxOnly` rejects an external Firstmate process by ancestry.
- `automation` uses an owner-only 0600 socket with no handshake.
- `password` uses the same 0600 socket plus `auth <password>`.
- `allowAll` uses a 0666 socket with no authentication.

The live default rejection was `Access denied - only processes started inside cmux can connect`.
The live password challenge was `Authentication required - send auth <password> first`.
The app configuration writer did not retain a hand-added socket password, which is why the operator guide requires Settings and a local Firstmate password source.

Current active CLI findings:

| Guarantee | Command shape | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create | `new-workspace --name <title> --cwd <dir> --focus false --id-format uuids` | Created one workspace with one surface without focusing it. |
| Fresh readiness | `list-panes --workspace <id> --json --id-format uuids` | Found a brand-new surface before content existed. |
| Fresh read counterexample | `read-screen` before any write | Returned `internal_error: Failed to read terminal text`. |
| Literal send | `send --workspace <id> --surface <id> -- <text>` | Left text unsubmitted. |
| Keys | `send-key ... enter|escape|ctrl-c` | All shared key operations worked. |
| Nested cwd | `current_directory` plus foreground subshell | Structured cwd froze; the marker-delimited `pwd` probe found the live cwd. |
| Last surface | `close-surface` on the only surface | Refused with `invalid_state: Cannot close the last surface`. |
| Last workspace | `close-workspace` on the only workspace in a window | Printed success but left the workspace present. |

The last-workspace workaround was reverified on 2026-07-10 in Automation mode.
After creating one unfocused unnamed sibling in the same window, `close-workspace` removed the exact task workspace and left only cmux's default sibling.
A selected non-last workspace closed directly, proving that window cardinality rather than selection is the trigger.

Source inspection confirmed each workspace constructor creates a new UUID with no restored-id input.
Recovery therefore remains title-based.
The bundled Claude wrapper was observed stripping `CMUX_*` variables on its failed socket-probe path while retaining the app bundle id, supporting the macOS-only bundle-id and ancestry fallbacks.

```sh
tests/fm-backend-cmux.test.sh
tests/fm-backend-cmux-smoke.test.sh
```

The real smoke proves socket access, fresh readiness, current-path probing, send and keys, bounded capture, title identity, and guarded exact cleanup.

### Claude composer confirmation

The borderless Claude composer confirmation was verified on 2026-08-09 with cmux 0.64.22 build 102 and Claude Code 2.1.226 on macOS aarch64.
An isolated real Claude worker rendered a bare `❯` plus U+00A0 row between horizontal rules.
The cmux classifier returned `empty`, and one `fm-send.sh --resolve-key <key> ALBATROSS` command - which used the typed path before ordinary task steers moved to the inbox - appended the matching `resolved` event before the worker reported completion.
The terminal capture contained exactly one submitted `❯ ALBATROSS` row.
The dated proof used this command:

```sh
FM_CMUX_CLAUDE_COMPOSER_LIVE=1 bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-cmux-claude-composer-live-e2e.test.sh
```

That guard still addresses the worker by task selector, so it no longer reaches the typed submit path and is not a current refresh entry point for this guarantee.
The portable classifier regression is `tests/fm-backend-cmux.test.sh`.

## Codex App host tools

A reusable Desktop host-tool smoke ran on 2026-07-06 against Codex Desktop bundle version 26.623.101652, build 4674, bundle id `com.openai.codex`.
Local paths and task-specific ids are intentionally not retained here.

The host-tool sequence was:

1. list a saved project;
2. create a Desktop-owned worktree thread;
3. recover and read the thread while active and after completion;
4. verify the thread appended a Firstmate status line and wrote its report;
5. send a follow-up to the same thread;
6. read the completed follow-up;
7. archive the exact thread;
8. read the archived transcript with state `notLoaded`.

Observed guarantee: a Desktop-owned thread can write Firstmate lifecycle files when the prompt provides an authorized absolute path, and create, send, read, and archive work at the Desktop host-tool layer.
The missing guarantee remains a supported shell-callable bridge that lets Firstmate perform those operations against the same visible Desktop endpoint.
App-server partial methods and raw socket experiments do not satisfy that bridge contract.

## Cursor Agent CLI

Cursor runs crewmate, scout, secondmate, and primary work; [`supervision.md`](supervision.md#cursor-primary-park-2026-08-13) owns the primary evidence.
The evidence below was produced on 2026-08-11 against the installed signed CLI on macOS 26.5.2 arm64 with tmux 3.6a, running as `kunchenguid`, and extended on 2026-08-13 with the tmux composer verdict below.

- Binary: `~/.local/bin/cursor-agent`, canonicalizing into `~/.local/share/cursor-agent/versions/2026.08.11-e8db854/cursor-agent`.
- Version: `cursor-agent --version` reported `2026.08.11-e8db854`, and `cursor-agent status` reported a logged-in account.
- Both installed names, `cursor-agent` and the legacy alias `agent`, resolve into that same versioned install tree.

Resolution prints the STABLE launcher rather than the canonical target, because the canonical path carries a version the CLI replaces on its own auto-update.

### Process identity

`#{pane_current_command}` and `ps -o comm=` disagree for cursor, which is why identity reads both:

| Source | Observed value |
| --- | --- |
| `#{pane_current_command}` | `node` |
| `ps -o comm=` | `/Users/<user>/.local/bin/cursor-agent` |
| child argv | `.../bin/cursor-agent --use-system-ca .../versions/2026.08.11-e8db854/index.js --trust --yolo` |

`node` matches no harness name pattern, so a cursor pane is identified from Cursor's own name or install tree in the path or argv[0].
An unrelated `node` or `agent` matches neither and classifies `other`, which the liveness callers fold into `ambiguous` rather than `dead`.
A live cursor pane returned `alive`; a plain shell pane in the same run returned `dead`.

### Environment markers and detection ordering

Read from the live agent process and from a tool subprocess it spawned:

| Marker | Where observed |
| --- | --- |
| `CURSOR_INVOKED_AS=cursor-agent` | the agent process itself, and its children |
| `CURSOR_AGENT=1` | child/tool processes only |
| `CURSOR_CONVERSATION_ID=<uuid>` | child/tool processes |
| `AGENT_TRANSCRIPTS=<projects-root>/<slug>/agent-transcripts` | child/tool processes |

Cursor does not clear an inherited `CLAUDECODE`, so ordering decides the verdict within the marker layer.
With both markers set and ancestry silent, `bin/fm-harness.sh` reports `cursor`; with `CLAUDECODE` alone it still reports `claude`.
[Harness detection precedence](#harness-detection-precedence) owns what happens when a structural ancestor of another harness is present, which outranks either marker.

### Composer

Cursor's composer is a BARE row whose prompt glyph is `→` (U+2192); there is no border.
Its idle placeholder is `Plan, search, build anything` in a fresh session and `Add a follow-up` after a completed turn.

The styled capture of an idle composer row was:

```
ESC[48;2;21;21;21m ESC[2m→ ESC[0;7mESC[48;2;21;21;21mPESC[0;2mESC[48;2;21;21;21mlan, search, build anythingESC[0m
```

The glyph and the placeholder tail are dim (SGR 2), but the cell under the terminal cursor is reverse video (SGR 0;7).
Reverse video is neither dim nor a dark foreground, so ghost stripping leaves a lone `P` and an idle composer read `pending` before the fix.
After teaching the shared classifier the glyph, both placeholders, and the plain-row remnant rule, the same captures read `empty` on the styled cursorless backends, while real typed text - including text typed to exactly match the placeholder - still read `pending`.
An unstyled capture has no ghost-strip proof and correctly stays `unknown`.

#### tmux composer verdict, corrected 2026-08-13

The 2026-08-11 record that a Cursor pane's tmux composer verdict is `unknown` in every state described the cursor-ANCHORED read, which remains true: `#{cursor_y}` was 25 with `#{cursor_flag}` 0 on an idle pane, pointing below the footer, so tmux's cursor row is not a composer locator for Cursor.
Read cursorlessly, the same live capture classifies correctly, so the composite verdict is no longer `unknown`:

```text
cursor_y=25  cursor_flag=0
with-cursor : unknown      cursorless : empty     (idle composer)
with-cursor : unknown      cursorless : pending   (real typed text, not submitted)
with-cursor : unknown      cursorless : unknown   (agent exited to a shell)
```

`bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh` therefore reclassifies cursorlessly only when the pane's foreground process group is provably Cursor, so every other harness keeps the strict blank-cursor-row posture.
That supplies the genuine composer-empty proof required for away-mode escalation delivery.
A live injection through `bin/fm-supervise-daemon.sh`'s own `inject_msg` into a real Cursor pane returned 0 and the pane processed the typed `FIRSTMATE_OP: v1 away-supervisor:` escalation.

`tests/fm-tmux-agent-liveness.test.sh` pins this with real processes and no Cursor installed: it asserts the cursor-anchored source is blind, that the composite still reads `empty` idle and `pending` with typed text, that an identical screen stays `unknown` when the pane is not Cursor, and that a stale Cursor screen over a dead shell never reads `empty`.

### Busy state

Cursor writes a per-conversation transcript at `<projects-root>/<workspace-slug>/agent-transcripts/<conversation-id>/<conversation-id>.jsonl`.
Each turn is bracketed by a `role:user` open and a typed `{"type":"turn_ended","status":...}` close.
Observed closes: `success` for a completed turn, and `aborted` with `"error":"User aborted/interrupted manually."` after a single Escape.

The trailing close landed 0 seconds after the pane's busy footer cleared on a normal turn.
The transcript does NOT accumulate one close per turn, so a count of closes is not a progress signal; only the trailing record is.
After an interrupt the aborted close was observed within seconds in some runs and not within twenty seconds in others, so `bin/fm-control-lib.sh` deliberately claims no cancellation acknowledgement for cursor.

Binding never reconstructs cursor's workspace-slug directory name, which collapses path separators.
Cursor records the exact absolute workspace path in each project directory's `.workspace-trusted`, and the binding matches on that value.

### Rendered busy token, delivery only

Mid-turn the pane showed a braille spinner plus a verb, and `ctrl+c to stop` on the composer row; both the verb line and that token were absent the instant the turn ended.
The same version rendered `Working` in one turn and `Running` in the next, so the TOKEN is matched and the verb is not.
This row is a delivery guard for submit acknowledgement only; recorded worker state comes from the transcript fold.

### Launch, lifecycle, and skills

| Fact | Observed |
| --- | --- |
| Workspace trust | `--trust` suppressed the prompt; `--yolo` alone did NOT, and the prompt blocks a fresh worktree |
| Autonomy | `--yolo` (alias of `--force`); the footer renders `Run Everything` |
| Worktree | `-w/--worktree` allocates a SECOND worktree under `~/.cursor/worktrees` and is never passed |
| Effort | no effort flag exists; requested effort stays in task metadata |
| Interrupt | single Escape; the pane showed `Cancelled` and the composer returned to its placeholder, so no clear key is needed |
| Exit | `/exit` |
| Skill invocation | `/<skill>`; cursor discovers firstmate's user-level skills, and `/no-mistakes` autocompleted with firstmate's own description and invoked the skill |
| Slash popup | real: the first Enter closes the popup and a SECOND Enter submits, the same hazard as grok, covered by the submit core's retried Enter |

### End-to-end

A throwaway scout was spawned through `bin/fm-spawn.sh --scout --backend tmux` on a real cursor worker and driven to completion:

1. the launch delivered its brief positionally and the agent executed it;
2. `state/<id>.cursor-session` was written with the task worktree;
3. the transcript fold read `busy` mid-turn and `idle` after it;
4. `bin/fm-send.sh` delivered a steer through the then-current typed path and exited 0;
5. `bin/fm-control.sh <id> interrupt` cancelled a running turn;
6. `bin/fm-control.sh <id> exit` stopped the agent;
7. `bin/fm-teardown.sh` refused until the scout's report and decision gate were satisfied, then removed the session record.

### Herdr backend

The tmux run above is the reference; this section is the separate Herdr proof, produced on 2026-08-12 against Herdr 0.8.0 (client and server, protocol 19) and the same signed `cursor-agent` 2026.08.11-e8db854 on macOS 26.5.2 arm64.
Every step ran inside an isolated `fm-lab-` session provisioned by `bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh`, launched from a neutral parent outside any Herdr pane, with the live default session's pane count checked before, during, and after; it stayed at 7 throughout.

**Herdr's native agent state is unusable for Cursor.**
A 60-sample probe of `agent get` across a full turn reported `agent_status=blocked` in every state - idle, mid-turn, and after.
The typed submit path's idle baseline is therefore structurally unreachable for Cursor, and every typed send falls into the composer branch.

| Pane state | Composer verdict | Rendered footer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Idle | `empty` | no busy token |
| Text typed, not submitted | `pending` | no busy token |
| Mid-turn | `pending` (placeholder plus `ctrl+c to stop` on one row) | `ctrl+c to stop` |

Herdr draws the composer's rules with the half-block glyphs U+2584 and U+2580 rather than the box-drawing family.
Before those were taught to the shared edge detector, a bare composer's wrap region ran through its own closing rule and swallowed the model and path footer, so an idle pane read `pending`.
Measured as an A/B on the same live pane, the pre-fix classifier returned `pending` and the current one returned `empty`.

The idle fix alone did not confirm typed delivery, because the composer branch reads the mid-turn row instead.
With the rendered-footer transition in place, a typed-plane `bin/fm-send.sh` invocation exited 0 and the steer executed in the pane; the same send previously exited 1 with `delivery unconfirmed; verdict=pending` on a message that had actually landed.

The rest of the lifecycle was driven end to end on that worker:

1. `bin/fm-spawn.sh --scout --backend herdr` placed the worker and it executed its brief;
2. the transcript fold read `busy` mid-turn and `idle` after, unchanged from tmux, so the recorded worker state is backend-agnostic;
3. `bin/fm-control.sh <id> interrupt` reported `cancel=unconfirmed` by design and the pane showed `Cancelled`, with the footer and the fold both returning to idle;
4. `bin/fm-control.sh <id> exit` stopped the agent through the slash popup and the pane returned to its shell;
5. `bin/fm-teardown.sh` refused until the scout's report and decision gate were satisfied, then removed the session record and returned the worktree.

Other harnesses on Herdr are unaffected by the edge-detector change.
All seven live panes of the running default session - one Pi, four Claude, two plain shells - classified identically under the pre-fix and current classifiers.

**Typed-submit confirmation is verified on tmux and Herdr only.**
Zellij, cmux, and Orca share a submit core that never consults the busy footer, so a typed-plane Cursor send there lands but `fm-send` reports delivery unconfirmed and exits non-zero; ordinary text steers ride the durable inbox and exit 0 at enqueue.
Teaching that shared core the same transition is deliberately separate work, because it changes the submit path for every harness on those three backends and needs its own live validation on each.

The portable regression is `tests/fm-cursor-harness.test.sh`, the composer captures are pinned in `tests/fm-composer-lib.test.sh`, and the Herdr submit and footer behavior is pinned in `tests/fm-backend-herdr.test.sh`.

## Pi supervision branch

The supervision-branch extension (`.pi/extensions/fm-branch-supervision.ts`, [docs/pi-supervision-branch.md](../pi-supervision-branch.md)) builds its second session through the Pi SDK surface: `createAgentSession` (including its `model`, `modelRuntime`, and `thinkingLevel` options), `DefaultResourceLoader` with `extensionFactories`, `SessionManager`, `createBashToolDefinition` with a `spawnHook`, `sendCustomMessage` for routine notes, `appendEntry` and `registerEntryRenderer` for captain outcomes, the `before_provider_request` hook, the command context's model registry for picker candidates, a fresh `ModelRuntime` for isolated-branch resolution, and Pi's own `getSupportedThinkingLevels`/`clampThinkingLevel` plus its `getThinkingLevel` and `thinking_level_select` extension surface for effort.
In TUI mode, its `/supervision-model` model list is drawn with Pi's own `SelectList`, `Input`, `fuzzyFilter`, and `DynamicBorder` through the extension context's `ui.custom` surface, which is what bounds and searches a long catalog.

Evidence produced 2026-08-25 on macOS 26.5.2 arm64, Node v24.13.1:

- Historical real-SDK guard: `FM_PI_BRANCH_LIVE_E2E=1 bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-pi-branch-live-e2e.test.sh` against the globally installed `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` 0.81.1 printed `ok - real Pi SDK 0.81.1 accepts the branch session construction and preserves an unpromptable wake`.
  The guard read no credentials and made no provider call: an isolated empty `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` left model resolution empty, so the branch's first prompt failed fast and exercised the former direct-branch fallback.
  That fallback probe predates watcher-owned settlement and is not current evidence for the replacement-safe delivery boundary.
  The same run confirms that a real `ModelRegistry` over that empty agent dir still exposes the picker-facing availability surface, then pins `openai/no-such-live-model` and proves that the branch's own `ModelRuntime` refuses the unresolvable pin instead of silently running supervision on main's model.
- Model-pin precedence: the same guard run printed `ok - real Pi SDK 0.81.1 applies an explicit branch model on create and over a reopened session's recorded model`.
  It declares a local `fm-live-fake` provider in an isolated `models.json`, never contacts it, and proves through `session.model` that an explicit model is applied on create, still wins over the model a reopened session recorded, and is absent-pin-restorable - the SDK behavior needed when a model or effort change reopens the current main session's branch conversation.
- Effort-pin vendor contract: the same guard run printed `ok - real Pi SDK 0.81.1 reports its own supported effort levels and applies an explicit branch effort over a reopened session's recorded level`.
  Over its own local never-contacted provider it confirms that `getSupportedThinkingLevels` still returns `["off","minimal","low","medium","high","xhigh","max"]` for a model mapping every extended level, narrows to `["off","minimal","low","medium","high"]` for a reasoning model mapping none, returns `["off"]` for a non-reasoning model, and that `clampThinkingLevel` lowers `max` to `high` on the narrow model while collapsing an unrecognized token to `off` - which is why the extension rejects an unrecognized pin before that clamp can see it.
  It then proves through `session.thinkingLevel` that an explicit effort is applied on create, that a reopened session with no override restores its own recorded level, that an explicit effort beats that recorded level, and that an over-ceiling effort is clamped rather than refused.
  The recorded-level cases need a session file Pi will actually restore from, and Pi flushes one only once an assistant message exists, so the guard appends the level change and that message through the real `SessionManager` rather than hand-writing the format.
- Picker primitives: on 2026-08-26, after the final portable-shell and sentinel fixes, `bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-pi-branch-extension.test.sh` again printed `ok - the installed Pi still bounds the picker's list and ranks its search` against the same installed 0.81.1 package.
  That case imports the real `SelectList`, `Input`, `fuzzyFilter`, and `DynamicBorder`, renders a 42-row catalog through the real `SelectList` at the visible bound the extension asks for, and fails naming the installed version if Pi stops exporting a primitive or stops bounding what it renders; it skips when no npm package is installed, and the portable stubbed cases in the same file hold the ordering, search, and branch-only-pin behavior everywhere.
- Strict typecheck: `tests/fm-pi-primary-types.test.sh` printed `ok - tracked Pi extensions pass strict no-emit typecheck against Pi 0.81.1` with the branch extension and its imported libraries included.
  This typecheck is also the enforcement for the extension's declared effort vocabulary: its bidirectional assertion against Pi's own `getThinkingLevel` return type fails the moment Pi adds or removes a thinking level, so the runtime list used to reject an unrecognized hand-edited pin cannot drift into a stale Firstmate catalog.
- Historical custom-message provider conversion: on 2026-08-26, `FM_PI_BRANCH_LIVE_E2E=1 bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-pi-branch-live-e2e.test.sh` against installed `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` 0.84.1 printed `ok - real Pi SDK 0.84.1 delivers a custom message to the provider as user text carrying only content, so the captain outcome's typed envelope is what reaches the model`.
  The guard passes a typed captain outcome and a plain rendered routine note through Pi's exported `convertToLlm`, proves that `customType` and `display` are not model-visible identity, and classifies the resulting provider text with `bin/fm-operational-input.sh`.
  This evidence explains the superseded model-relay path but is no longer the captain-delivery contract.

### 2026-08-28 Pi 0.84.4 SDK compatibility refresh

The credential-free live guard and strict typecheck were rerun against the installed `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` 0.84.4 package after the Pi primary compatibility repair.
The live guard used an isolated empty `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, inspected no credentials, and made no provider call.

```sh
npm exec --yes --package=typescript@5.9.3 -- bash tests/fm-pi-primary-types.test.sh
FM_PI_BRANCH_LIVE_E2E=1 bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-pi-branch-live-e2e.test.sh
```

```text
ok - tracked Pi extensions pass strict no-emit typecheck against Pi 0.84.4
ok - real Pi SDK 0.84.4 accepts the branch session construction and preserves an unpromptable wake
ok - real Pi SDK 0.84.4 applies an explicit branch model on create and over a reopened session's recorded model
ok - real Pi SDK 0.84.4 reports its own supported effort levels and applies an explicit branch effort over a reopened session's recorded level

FM_TEST_END 2026-08-29T01:01:01Z tests/fm-pi-branch-live-e2e.test.sh exit=0 duration_ms=2520 gate_skip=false
```

The focused extension suite also exercised the installed Pi 0.84.4 picker and outcome-renderer consumers; [`calm-mode-feasibility.md`](../calm-mode-feasibility.md#2026-08-28-pi-0844-outcome-renderer-compatibility-verification) owns the version-scoped renderer evidence.

### 2026-08-29 deterministic captain-outcome delivery

The credential-free live guard, focused extension suite, store suite, and strict typecheck were run against the locally installed `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` 0.84.3 package.
No model was selected or prompted, no provider call was made, and the active Pi session was not changed.

```sh
bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-pi-branch-extension.test.sh
bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-branch-supervision.test.sh
npm exec --yes --package=typescript@5.9.3 -- bash tests/fm-pi-primary-types.test.sh
FM_PI_BRANCH_LIVE_E2E=1 bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-pi-branch-live-e2e.test.sh
```

```text
ok - captain outcomes are exact and exactly once across crash, reload, busy main, compaction, and an unrelated assistant response
ok - startup replay cannot advance the cursor across an unrendered captain outcome
ok - tracked Pi extensions pass strict no-emit typecheck against Pi 0.84.3
ok - real Pi SDK 0.84.3 immediately renders appendEntry in the active transcript, persists it across reopen, and excludes it from model context
```

The live probe loads the extension through Pi's real resource loader and AgentSession, subscribes a stock InteractiveMode, verifies `ExtensionAPI.appendEntry` synchronously inserts the exact registered custom row into its active chat once, reopens the resulting session file to verify exact structured data, and verifies the entry is absent from `buildSessionContext().messages`.
The focused regression recreates the incident topology with stale compaction framing and an immediately preceding unrelated assistant response, then covers idle and busy delivery, cold startup with late fleet-lock acquisition, the crash boundary after entry persistence but before cursor advancement, and repeated reload without duplication.

### 2026-09-01 sequence-keyed captain-outcome processing

The focused extension suite, store suite, strict typecheck, and credential-free live guard were run against a locally installed `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` 0.84.4 package selected with `FM_PI_PACKAGE_DIR`, on macOS 26.5.0 arm64, Node v24.13.1.
No model was selected or prompted, no provider call was made, and the active Pi session was not changed.

```sh
FM_PI_PACKAGE_DIR=<pi-0.84.4 package> bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-pi-branch-extension.test.sh
bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-branch-supervision.test.sh
FM_PI_PACKAGE_DIR=<pi-0.84.4 package> npm exec --yes --package=typescript@5.9.3 -- bash tests/fm-pi-primary-types.test.sh
FM_PI_BRANCH_LIVE_E2E=1 FM_PI_PACKAGE_DIR=<pi-0.84.4 package> bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-pi-branch-live-e2e.test.sh
```

```text
ok - a captain outcome reaches main's model as one typed, sequence-keyed processing request while routine notes stay plain
ok - a captain outcome opens one sequence-keyed processing turn, survives empty and unrelated answers, is re-presented at run end and session start, and closes only on its acknowledgement
ok - the processed marker is sequence-bound, never ahead of the read cursor, never backwards, and migrates delivered history once
ok - tracked Pi extensions pass strict no-emit typecheck against Pi 0.84.4
ok - real Pi SDK 0.84.4 immediately renders appendEntry in the active transcript, persists it across reopen, and excludes it from model context
```

The focused regression recreates the two 2026-08-31 incident shapes against the real store scripts: a delivered decision outcome whose processing turn returns an empty assistant message, and one whose turn repeats an unrelated prior answer.
In both, the processed marker holds, the same sequence is presented again at the run boundary and after a session replacement, the triggered-turn budget gives way to a next-prompt copy without duplicates, and only `fm_branch_processed` with the presented sequence closes the outcome; a routine outcome never enters the path, and delivered history from before the marker existed is migrated once rather than re-presented.
On this machine the globally installed npm package is 0.81.1, whose stock `ToolExecutionComponent` rendering differs from the 0.84 line and fails the suite's first rendering-consumer case before any delivery case runs, which is why `FM_PI_PACKAGE_DIR` points at the 0.84.4 install above.

### 2026-09-02 historical post-construction provider-error fallback

The focused extension suite, strict typecheck, and real-SDK guard were run against the npm `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` 0.84.4 package on macOS 26.5.0 arm64, Node v24.13.1, before fallback ownership moved from the branch extension to the watcher.
The real-SDK case configured an isolated local OpenAI-compatible model, intercepted its only `fetch` in-process with the incident's non-retryable 429 `Monthly usage limit reached` response, read no user credential, and allowed no external provider request.
It proved that Pi persisted an assistant message with `stopReason: "error"` and resolved the constructed branch prompt normally, after which the extension released the claimed-row grant, retained the durable queue row, and returned the exact wake to main as a follow-up.

```sh
FM_PI_PACKAGE_DIR="$HOME/.npm/_npx/1f276a68aabfc75c/node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent" bash tests/fm-pi-branch-extension.test.sh
FM_PI_PACKAGE_DIR="$HOME/.npm/_npx/1f276a68aabfc75c/node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent" bash tests/fm-pi-primary-types.test.sh
FM_PI_BRANCH_LIVE_E2E=1 FM_PI_PACKAGE_DIR="$HOME/.npm/_npx/1f276a68aabfc75c/node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent" bash tests/fm-pi-branch-live-e2e.test.sh
```

```text
ok - a settled branch turn without a durable outcome falls back and releases its grant for main replay
ok - post-construction provider errors fall back immediately and repeated failures defer later wakes directly to main
ok - tracked Pi extensions pass strict no-emit typecheck against Pi 0.84.4
ok - real Pi SDK 0.84.4 returns a post-construction 429 wake to main without losing its durable row
```

The current portable regression proves that only consecutive provider errors count toward the two-error broken-branch latch: a durable report between errors resets the streak, the error that reaches the threshold rejects to watcher-owned fallback, and the next wake remains on main without another branch prompt.
`tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh` owns the provider-free integration evidence that watcher fallback remains pending until Pi accepts the main follow-up or the branch settles successfully, and that a follow-up accepted while main is streaming neither stalls the successor chain nor escapes replacement replay until Pi consumes it.
[`pi-supervision-branch.md`](../pi-supervision-branch.md) owns the current cooldown, recovery, and re-latch contract and points to the regression that now covers it.

Scope of the earlier evidence: the installed signed `pi` CLI (0.82.0 at verification time) is a compiled binary whose bundled SDK is not importable from Node, so the importable npm package is the only surface the guard and the typecheck can pin.
The extension executes inside the signed CLI's own runtime, so a CLI upgrade can drift ahead of the pinned npm surface; refresh the SDK construction, picker, renderer, and type evidence after every Pi upgrade by rerunning the applicable live guard probes, picker regression, and strict typecheck above (point `FM_PI_PACKAGE_DIR` at a matching npm install when one exists).
The live guard now drives both extensions through the watcher-owned settlement handshake, requires rejected branch settlement before main delivery, and verifies successor-delivery confirmation; rerun it against the matching importable Pi package to refresh end-to-end fallback evidence.

### 2026-09-02 streaming-time watcher delivery

The focused watcher suite, strict typecheck, and credential-free live guard were run against the npm `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` 0.84.4 package selected with `FM_PI_PACKAGE_DIR`, on macOS 26.6.2 arm64, Node v24.14.1, after the watcher extension stopped waiting for `before_agent_start` before settling a main delivery.
No credential was read, no request left the machine, and the active Pi session was not changed.

```sh
bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh
FM_PI_PACKAGE_DIR=<pi-0.84.4 package> npm exec --yes --package=typescript@5.9.3 -- bash tests/fm-pi-primary-types.test.sh
FM_PI_BRANCH_LIVE_E2E=1 FM_PI_PACKAGE_DIR=<pi-0.84.4 package> bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-pi-branch-live-e2e.test.sh
```

```text
ok - Pi hung successor falls back to one typed actionable wake
ok - Pi streaming-time wake delivery keeps the successor chain and replays only unconsumed wakes
ok - Pi retries a verified successor that failed during wake delivery once that delivery settles
ok - tracked Pi extensions pass strict no-emit typecheck against Pi 0.84.4
ok - real Pi SDK 0.84.4 queues a streaming-time watcher wake without before_agent_start, keeps the successor chain, and surfaces consumption of both follow-ups
```

The live probe loads the tracked watcher extension through Pi's real resource loader into a real AgentSession whose only provider is a local fake with its fetch intercepted in-process and held open mid-stream.
It proved that a follow-up the extension sends while main is streaming raises no `before_agent_start` at queue time or when the run reaches it, joins the run as a user `message_start` carrying the exact wake text in its own model turn, and is followed by a verified successor and delivery of the next close; a follow-up sent to the idle main raises `before_agent_start` with the exact text before its user `message_start`.
The portable regression drives the same shape with a fake main that never raises `before_agent_start` while streaming, then proves a replacement replays only the follow-up Pi had not consumed and that an exhausted restoration delivers its typed failure without launching a further arm.
A second regression holds a branch settlement open while the verified successor exits with a failure, and proves that failure takes the ordinary bounded retry once the delivery settles rather than leaving the generation with no watcher and no retry.

### 2026-09-04 off-thread supervision outcome delivery

The real-TUI responsiveness guard, focused extension suite, store suite, and strict typecheck were run on macOS 26.5.0 arm64, Node v24.13.1, tmux 3.6a, against the signed Pi launcher 0.82.0 for the TUI arms and the npm `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` 0.81.1 package for the typecheck.
The lab used a scratch `FM_HOME`, a scratch project holding a copy of the tracked extension, a private tmux socket, a scratch session directory, and `--offline`; only `/new` was ever sent, so no model turn ran and no request left the machine, and the captain's own Pi session was not touched.

```sh
FM_PI_BRANCH_RESPONSIVENESS_E2E=1 bash tests/fm-pi-branch-responsiveness-live-e2e.test.sh
bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-pi-branch-extension.test.sh
bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-branch-supervision.test.sh
npm exec --yes --package=typescript@5.9.3 -- bash tests/fm-pi-primary-types.test.sh
```

```text
pi 0.82.0 keystroke echo, worst observed: floor 22.6 ms, extension idle 35.6 ms, extension delivering 36.8 ms
ok - supervision outcome delivery keeps the real Pi 0.82.0 TUI echoing keystrokes at its unloaded floor
ok - outcome delivery keeps the event loop running and interleaved reports stay ordered and exactly once
ok - a session replaced mid-delivery cancels cleanly and the stored outcome still arrives exactly once
ok - a failing store script surfaces to the branch and its outcome is neither lost nor delivered twice
ok - a failed cursor write re-delivers a routine note exactly once more while a captain outcome stays deduplicated
skip: installed Pi 0.81.1 predates the stock renderer contract 0.84.4 this case compares against
ok - tracked Pi extensions pass strict no-emit typecheck against Pi 0.81.1
```

That skip is the renderer case declining to render a verdict on a Pi older than the contract it compares against: since 0.84.4 the stock renderer no longer supplies an implicit reset at multiline boundaries and the extension emits that reset itself, so an older installed Pi differs legitimately.
It names the installed version and the floor rather than degrading quietly, and a package whose version cannot be read at all is still a failure.

The same guard against the pre-change extension in the same lab measured a 676.9 ms worst keystroke echo while delivering two outcomes and a 295.3 ms worst echo with nothing to deliver, against a 49.2 ms extension-free floor, and failed as designed.
Measured through the same real `fm_branch_report` tool and real `bin/` scripts with a 1 ms interval timer, the largest single block of the JavaScript thread fell from 273 ms to 2.0 ms for a routine outcome, from 286 ms to 2.0 ms for a captain outcome, and from 134 ms to 1.9 ms for main's acknowledgement, against a 1.3-2.2 ms idle-loop floor.
Those absolute figures are specific to this host and Pi version; the guards assert the relationship (delivery must stay in the class of the same machine's own floor) rather than a remembered millisecond number.

### 2026-09-18 away posture parks main

The watcher and branch extension suites, the fleet-record, decision-answer, return, and merge suites, the credential-free live guard, and the strict typecheck were run on macOS 26.5 arm64 (Darwin 25.5.0), Node v24.13.1, against the globally installed npm `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` 0.81.1 package for the live guard and the npx-cached 0.85.1 package for the typecheck.
No model was selected or prompted, no provider call was made, and the captain's own Pi session was not changed.

```sh
bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh tests/fm-pi-branch-extension.test.sh
bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-branch-supervision.test.sh tests/fm-send-resolve-key.test.sh tests/fm-afk-return.test.sh tests/fm-pr-merge.test.sh

FM_PI_PACKAGE_DIR=<pi-0.85.1 package> npm exec --yes --package=typescript@5.9.3 -- bash tests/fm-pi-primary-types.test.sh
```

```text
ok - under the away-posture record every actionable row is offered to the branch while broken-queue wakes and watcher-failure alarms still reach main
ok - under the away-posture record the wake carries the verbatim read-back tail, claims every row, opens no processing turn, cancels a pending request, and presents the accumulated rows after archive
ok - an accepted away-only wake rejects after archive, while a drained task-local wake stays a quiet no-op
ok - a claimed heartbeat row on a non-heartbeat away wake lifts task scoping for the fleet report
ok - the away-posture record relocates the PR merge and a spawn under the spend cap to the branch, never local landing, and only while confirmed and valid
ok - relocated branch spawn admits only already-queued dispatchable work, including on a manual-backend home
ok - the away spend cap is rechecked under the task-set lock so concurrent spawns cannot both publish
ok - fm-send --resolve-key: a decision answer refuses the attended branch before sending, a blocked: key stays steering, and the away-posture record relocates the answer
ok - under the away-posture record the branch merges a granted green task, is held without a grant, cannot waive a red check, and is refused at the partition while attended
ok - real Pi SDK 0.81.1 accepts the branch session construction and preserves an unpromptable wake
ok - tracked Pi extensions pass strict no-emit typecheck against Pi 0.85.1
```

Every record read in those regressions ultimately goes through the real `bin/fm-afk-contract.sh`, with fixture wrappers used only to archive at deterministic call boundaries; an absent record, an archived record, and an invalid record are proven to restore attended guarded-action behavior rather than being assumed to.
Against the installed 0.81.1 package the typecheck reports a pre-existing `ModelsRefreshOptions.providers` mismatch in the branch's provider-registration path that this change does not touch; the option exists from the 0.84 line on, which is why the typecheck evidence uses the newer package as the earlier entries do.
The real Pi/Herdr return guard (`FM_AFK_PI_HERDR_E2E=1 tests/fm-afk-pi-herdr-return-e2e.test.sh`) remains the owner of the live return-brief proof; it loads no supervision extension into its synthetic primary and does not yet exercise the parked-main scenario, which is a follow-up for a Herdr-lab-guarded task.

### 2026-09-20 the away words execute

The away-record owner, launch, return, merge, branch-supervision, contributions, merge-poll security, and Pi branch extension suites were run on macOS 26.6.2 arm64 (Darwin 25.6.0), Node v24.14.1, after the away record became the captain's words alone (version 2, with version 1 still readable) and the per-task merge-grant list retired.
No model was selected or prompted, no provider call was made, and the captain's own Pi session was not changed.
The 2026-09-18 entry above records the retired grant model's merge matrix; the lines below supersede it for the merge gate.

```sh
bin/fm-test-run.sh tests/fm-afk-contract.test.sh tests/fm-afk-launch.test.sh tests/fm-afk-return.test.sh tests/fm-pr-merge.test.sh tests/fm-branch-supervision.test.sh tests/fm-contributions.test.sh tests/fm-pr-check-security.test.sh tests/fm-pi-branch-extension.test.sh
```

```text
ok - the read-back renders the words verbatim beside the expected return, spend cap, and reach line
ok - one enter call writes a version 2 record, announces hold-for-return only, reads it back without asking for a go, and every read subcommand reflects it
ok - the retired propose, confirm, and --proposal inputs are refused by name and write nothing
ok - retired clause fields, --grant, and the clause and grant subcommands are refused by name
ok - a version 1 record validates, reads its words and scalars with the clause and grant sections ignored, refreshes untouched, and archives
ok - new words over a live version 1 record archive it and write version 2 with the same session start
ok - enter: the retired --grant flag is refused by name and leaves the standing record alone
ok - the return brief renders health, the words with the session account, waiting, could-not-fix, handled, and cost from durable records, and the gate shrinks to what the away session could not fix
ok - while the away-posture record exists any green merge lands under away authority, yolo or not, and attended merges stay untagged
ok - under the away-posture record the branch merges a green task, is refused on a red check with or without --allow-red, and is refused at the partition while attended
ok - the away record does not bypass red checks, and a recorded pr= must match the URL
ok - no away-record archive or replacement lands between the authority read and the merge
ok - a record made unreadable before the merge's own authority read refuses the merge
ok - queued merges retain their away authority after captain return
ok - branch prompt is byte-stable across homes, cwd, timezone, and time, above the cache floor
ok - under the away-posture record the wake carries the verbatim read-back tail, claims every row, opens no processing turn, cancels a pending request, and presents the accumulated rows after archive
```

The merge suite and the security suite dominate the wall time.

## Native Codex through Pi

Verified on 2026-09-08 with Pi 0.85.1 and the installed `pi-codex-native` 0.2.1 adapter.
Run this token-free guard after updating Pi, Codex, or the adapter:

```sh
FM_PI_CODEX_NATIVE_LIVE=1 bash tests/fm-pi-codex-native.test.sh
```

Observed result: `"result": "PASS"`.
The guard runs the real Pi runtime, native adapter, three FirstMate primary extensions, native MCP transport, and FirstMate's durable outcome scripts in an isolated home.
It verifies native `ultra` on initial and operational turns and after restart, startup operational input, watcher arming, a notification while main is idle, outcome read and one acknowledgement, refusal of a duplicate acknowledgement, and no reprocessing after restart.
Its native App Server peer and watcher-close process are deterministic fixtures; it does not claim a real backend or a live model was tested by that command.
`tests/fm-busy-state.test.sh`, `tests/fm-busy-adapter-wiring.test.sh`, and `tests/fm-watch-triage.test.sh` cover separate progress notification, unchanged semantic busy state, rejection of a superseded worker's events, and progress refreshing the busy-age bound without fabricating a completed turn.

## Oh My Pi (omp)

omp runs crewmate, scout, secondmate, and primary work; [`supervision.md`](supervision.md#omp-oh-my-pi-native-delivery-2026-09-05) owns the primary evidence.
The evidence below was produced on 2026-09-05 against omp 18.1.11 (`~/.local/bin/omp`, a Bun-compiled single binary) on macOS 26 arm64 through the Herdr backend with the `openai-codex/gpt-6-astra` model, building on the 2026-09-02 adapter investigation against 18.1.2.

### Process identity and markers

`ps -o comm=` reports the bare name `omp` for the agent process, from both its `!` bash path and the model's bash tool, so identity is the anchored name; `ompd` and `comp` never match.
omp publishes no harness marker: `PI_CODING_AGENT` is absent from the binary, and the default profile sets neither `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` nor `OMP_PROFILE` in the process environment.
`FM_OMP_HARNESS=omp` is Firstmate's own launch marker and wins over an inherited `CLAUDECODE` only under a real omp ancestor; `tests/fm-omp-harness.test.sh` pins both directions with real processes.

### Composer

Under the captain's `unicode` symbol preset the idle screen through Herdr was a bare `❯` (U+276F) row followed directly by the status row:

```text
❯
 π  · ◔ GPT-6-Astra · 🌳 …-workspace · ⑂ detached · ◫ 15.4%/272K ⟲ · (sub)
```

Before the status-row rule the shared classifier folded that row into the bare composer's wrap region and read the idle pane `pending`, so `bin/fm-send.sh` skipped its doorbell on the first live omp worker.
After the rule, the same live Herdr capture read `empty`, a steer's doorbell landed, and the worker opened a turn on it.
`tests/fm-composer-lib.test.sh` pins the unicode idle row, the nerd-preset idle row, the busy spinner row, and typed text over the same fixture in both locales.

### Busy state and lifecycle

| Fact | Observed |
| --- | --- |
| Semantic source | `omp-ext`: `busy source=omp-ext event=agent-start` on the brief, `idle source=omp-ext event=agent-end` at its natural end, `busy` again on a steer, `idle` after a control-plane interrupt |
| Rendered busy row | `⎋ Working…` (U+2026) above the composer and a braille spinner plus elapsed cell (`⠧ 36s`) in the status row; the omp busy regex accepts only those two TUI signals, not the `Working...` that headless `-p` writes to stderr, since no supervised omp pane runs headless |
| Interrupt | `bin/fm-control.sh <id> interrupt` delivered a single Escape (`verified=agent-alive cancel=unconfirmed`), the composer read `empty`, and omp raised `agent_end` |
| Exit | `bin/fm-control.sh <id> exit` typed `/quit`; Herdr then reported the pane `dead` |
| Extension loading | a file named both by `-e` and by `<cwd>/.omp/extensions` loads twice; discovery is top-level and cwd-only |
| Extension tools | the openai-codex model invokes a registered tool by writing `xd://<tool>` through omp's virtual-file bridge |

### End-to-end

A throwaway scout was spawned through `bin/fm-spawn.sh --scout --harness omp --model openai-codex/gpt-6-astra --effort low` on Herdr and driven to completion:

1. the launch delivered its brief positionally under the tracked posture overlay and the agent executed it with no approval prompt;
2. the busy record moved seed, busy, idle exactly as the extension contract states;
3. the report landed and the `done:` status line was appended;
4. `bin/fm-send.sh` rang the doorbell once the composer read `empty`, and the worker opened a turn on the inbox record;
5. `bin/fm-control.sh <id> interrupt` cancelled the running turn;
6. `bin/fm-control.sh <id> exit` stopped the agent and `bin/fm-teardown.sh` returned the worktree and closed the item.

`FM_OMP_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-omp-primary-live-e2e.test.sh` refreshes the primary evidence; the worker path above is refreshed by repeating the scout dispatch after any omp upgrade.
