# Restart second mates onto the current instruction surface and launch-time
# wiring, persisting their open records first.
#
# Usage: fm-secondmate-restart.sh <secondmate-id>... [--help]
#
# This is the executable half of /updatefirstmate's reload step. A running agent
# holds AGENTS.md and every skill it has loaded frozen from launch, and no
# verified harness offers a reload, so a re-read steer cannot replace either -
# it appends a second copy of the mate's own job description with no defined
# precedence. Replacing the agent is the only mechanism that guarantees the new
# bytes are the ones read, and the only one that re-resolves the launch-time
# wiring - harness, model, effort, turn-end hooks, and every other flag a harness
# reads once at startup. That second half is why the update pass sends every live
# mate here, including one already on the target commit: launch-time wiring is
# not derivable from a git diff, so an unchanged tracked surface does not mean
# the running agent is already on the current behavior.
#
# The cost of that guarantee is the conversation, which is why this command runs
# in two phases and why the first one is a GATE, not a courtesy:
#
#   A. PERSIST. Every mate is asked, in one marked request, to durably record the
#      open work it holds only in conversation - a task for each unfiled open
#      record, including a captain call it formed but never registered, and a
#      status correction for each task whose recorded state is now stale. That is
#      the /stow skill's "Open-record persistence" contract and nothing else from
#      it: no memory, learnings, or captain-preference sweep, which would make
#      every instruction update cost far more than the reload it is paying for.
#      All requests go out before any restart, so a slow mate delays only its own
#      restart instead of serializing the fleet behind it.
#   B. RESTART. Only after that mate's own correlated answer lands on the parent
#      channel. The gate is that answer, never a wall clock, so a mate that is
#      mid-turn queues the request behind that turn; the bound below exists to
#      end the wait, not to authorize a restart without the answer. A timeout
#      deliberately leaves that unanswered expectation open: it is a genuine
#      open loop owned by the ordinary pending-reply recovery ladder, not state
#      this restart pass may close.
#
# A mate whose persist answer did not arrive or whose runtime cannot prove a
# restart gets the ordinary re-read nudge and is reported as a nudge, never as a
# clean reload. Once a relaunch is attempted, any failed or ambiguous result is
# reported as unknown rather than attributing it to either incarnation.
#
# Placement changes the transport and nothing else. A local mate is restarted
# with bin/fm-control.sh <id> relaunch; a remote mate is restarted by running THAT
# SAME command on its host over bin/fm-on.sh, through the host-local
# fm-remote-secondmate-control.sh relaunch verb. The restart decision, the
# profile, the request text, the bound, the failure vocabulary, and this report
# are all computed here in the primary and are identical for both.
#
# Nothing here forces, stashes, or discards anything. bin/fm-control.sh owns the
# restart transaction, its checkpoint, its journal, and its rollback; a refusal
# before the agent is stopped leaves the mate running exactly as it was.
#
# Restart candidacy itself belongs to bin/fm-update.sh, which knows which homes
# the update pass actually left on the target commit; this command re-checks
# capability on its own argv rather than trusting a caller's list.
#
# Environment knobs:
#   FM_SECONDMATE_PERSIST_WAIT  seconds to wait for one mate's persist answer (900)
#   FM_SECONDMATE_PERSIST_POLL  seconds between checks of that answer (5)
#
# Exit status: 0 every named mate restarted; 3 at least one was nudged or left
# unreached and every mate was still accounted for; 1 the input itself is
# unusable; 2 invalid use.
