# fm-decision-hold.sh - deterministic mechanics for durable captain decisions.
#
# The semantic policy is owned once by
# .agents/skills/decision-hold-lifecycle/SKILL.md. This script never reads report,
# visual-review, chat, or terminal prose to guess whether a decision exists.
# The invoking agent inventories unresolved decisions, assigns stable keys, and
# routes dependent work. This script supplies deterministic identities, creates
# and verifies structured tasks-axi captain holds, records completion attestation
# in the originating task's metadata, and requires a durable captain decision
# record before it closes or repairs a hold.
#
# A hold identity is <origin-id>-decision-<decision-key>. Origin ids and decision
# keys must already be privacy-safe slugs. Repeating `hold` with the same identity
# is idempotent. A different decision key creates a different backlog identity.
# All backlog mutations run in the active FM_HOME, which keeps main-home and
# secondmate-home ownership aligned with the work that discovered the decision.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-decision-hold.sh id <origin-id> <decision-key>
#   fm-decision-hold.sh hold <origin-id> <decision-key> \
#     --title <title> --reason <reason> [--repo <repo>]
#   fm-decision-hold.sh complete <origin-id> (--none | <decision-key>...)
#   fm-decision-hold.sh verify <origin-id>
#   fm-decision-hold.sh resolve <origin-id> <decision-key> \
#     --decision-file <path> --routed-to <task-id> [--routed-to <task-id>...]
#   fm-decision-hold.sh decline <origin-id> <decision-key> --decision-file <path>
#   fm-decision-hold.sh repair <origin-id> <decision-key> --decision-file <path>
#
# `complete` is the shared investigation and visual-review completion gate.
# `--none` is an explicit semantic attestation that the just-reviewed surface has
# no unresolved captain decision. Later review passes may add keys; a live task's
# metadata inventory is unioned idempotently. A post-teardown visual review can
# complete against the surviving report and holds without recreating task state.
# `verify` is read-only and is called by scout teardown so teardown cannot erase a
# source before this gate has succeeded.
#
# `resolve` and `decline` close active holds; `repair` attests a hold already closed
# outside this script. All three paths require a non-empty captain decision file of
# at most 8192 bytes, record the same durable resolution block in the hold body, and
# store the decision digest plus routed identities so an exact retry is idempotent
# while a changed decision or, for `resolve`, routed set is rejected. New records
# include a `Resolution mode:` naming their path; older routed records remain valid.
#
# `resolve` is the routed path. It requires every --routed-to task to exist and to
# be blocked by the hold. It writes the captain decision and routed identities into
# the hold body, clears those dependency edges, and only then marks the hold Done.
# A failure before the final step leaves the captain hold open.
# Successful resolve output also lists the routed identities with a pointer to the
# policy owner's post-resolution review; that reminder is advisory, not a guard.
#
# `decline` is the unrouted path for a decision the captain answered with no
# follow-up work. It takes no --routed-to task, records `(none)` as the routed
# identities, and closes an actively held hold. It refuses while any task is still
# blocked by the hold, because releasing routed work without recording it is
# `resolve`'s job.
#
# `repair` records the missing resolution block on a hold that was already closed
# outside this script, so `verify` stops failing on an origin whose decision was
# genuinely answered. It never reopens a hold, never clears a dependency edge, and
# refuses a hold that is still actively held, so an unanswered decision keeps
# blocking teardown until `resolve` or `decline` closes it with the captain's word.
# It also refuses an identity that does not carry surviving captain-hold
# provenance, so an ordinary captain-kind task cannot be repaired into a decision.
