# fm-decision-hold.sh - deterministic mechanics for durable captain decisions.
#
# The semantic policy is owned once by
# .agents/skills/decision-hold-lifecycle/SKILL.md. This script never reads report,
# visual-review, chat, or terminal prose to guess whether a decision exists.
# The invoking agent inventories unresolved decisions, assigns stable keys, and
# routes dependent work. This script supplies deterministic identities, creates
# and verifies structured tasks-axi captain holds, records completion attestation
# in the originating task's metadata, and requires a durable captain decision
# record before it closes or repairs a hold.
#
# A hold identity is <origin-id>-decision-<decision-key>. Origin ids and decision
# keys must already be privacy-safe slugs. Repeating `hold` with the same identity
# is idempotent. A different decision key creates a different backlog identity.
# All backlog mutations run in the active FM_HOME, which keeps main-home and
# secondmate-home ownership aligned with the work that discovered the decision.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-decision-hold.sh id <origin-id> <decision-key>
#   fm-decision-hold.sh hold <origin-id> <decision-key> \
#     --title <title> --reason <reason> [--repo <repo>]
#   fm-decision-hold.sh complete <origin-id> (--none | <decision-key>...)
#   fm-decision-hold.sh verify <origin-id>
#   fm-decision-hold.sh resolve <origin-id> <decision-key> \
#     --decision-file <path> --routed-to <task-id> [--routed-to <task-id>...]
#   fm-decision-hold.sh answer <origin-id> <decision-key> --decision-file <path>
#   fm-decision-hold.sh answers <origin-id> --source <provenance>   (keyed answers on stdin)
#   fm-decision-hold.sh bind <source-id> <origin-id>
#   fm-decision-hold.sh unbind <source-id>
#   fm-decision-hold.sh binding <source-id>
#   fm-decision-hold.sh decline <origin-id> <decision-key> --decision-file <path>
#   fm-decision-hold.sh repair <origin-id> <decision-key> --decision-file <path>
#
# `complete` is the shared investigation and visual-review completion gate.
# `--none` is an explicit semantic attestation that the just-reviewed surface has
# no unresolved captain decision. Later review passes may add keys; a live task's
# metadata inventory is unioned idempotently. A post-teardown visual review can
# complete against the surviving report and holds without recreating task state.
# `verify` is read-only and is called by scout teardown so teardown cannot erase a
# source before this gate has succeeded.
#
# `resolve`, `answer`, and `decline` close active holds; `repair` attests a hold
# already closed outside this script. All four paths require a non-empty captain
# decision file of at most 8192 bytes, record the same durable resolution block in
# the hold body, and store the decision digest plus routed identities so an exact
# retry is idempotent while a changed decision or, for `resolve`, routed set is
# rejected. New records include a `Resolution mode:` naming their path; older
# routed records remain valid.
#
# `resolve` is the routed path. It requires every --routed-to task to exist and to
# be blocked by the hold. It writes the captain decision and routed identities into
# the hold body, clears those dependency edges, and only then marks the hold Done.
# A failure before the final step leaves the captain hold open.
# Successful resolve output also lists the routed identities with a pointer to the
# policy owner's post-resolution review; that reminder is advisory, not a guard.
#
# `answer` is the answer-time closure path, the hold ledger's counterpart to
# `fm-send.sh --resolve-key`: it exists so the act that carries the captain's
# answer is the act that closes the hold, instead of leaving closure to a
# separate later call nobody is forced to make. It records the captain's answer
# on an actively held hold, records `(none)` as the routed identities because no
# follow-up work has been routed behind the hold yet, and closes it. It shares
# every guard `decline` has, including the refusal while any task is still
# blocked by the hold, so a decision whose follow-up work is already routed still
# goes through `resolve` and the routed-vs-unrouted distinction survives. It says
# only that the captain answered; `decline` still says the captain answered with
# no follow-up work at all.
#
# ONE KEYED-ANSWER INTAKE, FED BY EVERY CHANNEL.
# "A keyed answer closes its matching hold" is a single capability, owned here
# and nowhere else. `answers` is its channel-agnostic entry point: it reads
# `<decision-key>\t<answer>\t<label>` lines on stdin, maps each key to this
# origin's `<origin-id>-decision-<key>` hold, and closes it through the very same
# `answer` path above, so every guard applies identically no matter which channel
# the answer arrived on. `--source` is provenance text recorded in the durable
# decision, never a behavior switch: this command has no per-channel branch and
# no knowledge of chat, review decks, or any transport.
#
# A channel's ONLY job is to turn whatever it received into those keyed lines and
# pipe them here. It must never map keys to holds, build decision records, decide
# resolve-versus-decline, or close a hold itself. A future channel needs no change
# here at all.
#
# The decision text is a pure function of (source, key, answer, label), which is
# what makes a replayed delivery an idempotent no-op rather than a rejected
# "different captain decision". A key whose hold is absent, already closed, or
# still blocking routed work is reported as `skipped:` and left for `resolve`;
# skipping is never forced closure, and the command exits nonzero when any key
# was skipped.
#
# `bind`, `unbind`, and `binding` record which origin a captured-answer SOURCE
# belongs to, for any channel whose answers arrive detached from the origin (a
# process-event source id, for example). The binding is a private record under
# `state/decision-bindings/`; a source with no binding feeds nothing, so this
# whole path is opt-in per source and an unbound source behaves as if it did not
# exist. `bind` deliberately does not require the source to exist yet, so a
# channel can be bound BEFORE it is armed and never produce an answer that has
# nowhere to go.
#
# `decline` is the unrouted path for a decision the captain answered with no
# follow-up work. It takes no --routed-to task, records `(none)` as the routed
# identities, and closes an actively held hold. It refuses while any task is still
# blocked by the hold, because releasing routed work without recording it is
# `resolve`'s job.
#
# `repair` records the missing resolution block on a hold that was already closed
# outside this script, so `verify` stops failing on an origin whose decision was
# genuinely answered. It never reopens a hold, never clears a dependency edge, and
# refuses a hold that is still actively held, so an unanswered decision keeps
# blocking teardown until `resolve` or `decline` closes it with the captain's word.
# It also refuses an identity that does not carry surviving captain-hold
# provenance, so an ordinary captain-kind task cannot be repaired into a decision.
