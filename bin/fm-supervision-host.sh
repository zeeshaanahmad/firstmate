# fm-supervision-host.sh - the supervision host: watcher-cycle ownership plus a
# headless engine session that runs the supervision branch's contract beside a
# non-Pi primary (docs/supervision-host.md owns the design).
#
# Usage:
#   fm-supervision-host.sh park [--restart]
#
# A primary's arm owner runs this in place of bin/fm-watch-arm.sh when the home
# opted in (config/supervision-host): the Claude Stop auto-arm
# (bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh), the Cursor stop-hook park
# (bin/fm-turnend-guard-cursor.sh), the OpenCode TUI plugin
# (.opencode/plugins/fm-primary-watch-arm.js), the omp watch extension
# (.omp/extensions/fm-primary-omp-watch.ts), Grok's model-owned background arm
# (docs/supervision-protocols/grok.md), and Codex's foreground checkpoint
# (bin/fm-watch-checkpoint.sh). To that owner it IS an arm: it prints the
# arm's own lines and exits only when main is needed, and stays parked across
# every close it handled itself. Each owner passes its harness as
# FM_SUPERVISION_HOST_PRIMARY, which the engine carries as the primary pin.
#
# OUTPUT, the contract every owner reads. The first cycle's status line
# ("watcher: started ..." or "watcher: attached ...") is printed as soon as the
# arm prints it, so an owner that waits for arm readiness sees it at once;
# everything else is printed in one write when the host exits: the close as
# the arm printed it (without that status line), then any "supervision-host:"
# lines. A "supervision-host:" line is a wake in its own right (the park
# boundary prints nothing else); "supervision-host stood down: ..." means this
# session or generation no longer owns supervision and the owner stands down
# silently; an exit status above 128, or no output at all, means the host
# itself died and the owner retries it. Any other close is judged exactly as
# the arm's. --restart starts the first cycle with fm-watch-arm.sh --restart,
# and an FM_WATCH_PREDECESSOR_ARM_PID the owner passes reaches that first
# cycle only, for owners that start their own successor after every close
# (OpenCode, omp).
#
# THE LOOP. It owns watcher cycles through bin/fm-watch-arm.sh. On each
# actionable close:
#   - attended (no away-posture record state/.afk-contract): it exits with the
#     close exactly as the arm printed it, so main is woken for every wake as
#     it is without the host (the attended posture moves onto the host in a
#     later step, docs/supervision-host.md "Scope");
#   - away (the record exists): it starts and verifies the successor watcher
#     cycle and confirms the handling handoff (the order docs/watcher-
#     continuity.md owns), computes the rows the branch may claim with the
#     dispatch owner (bin/fm-branch-dispatch.mjs), publishes that grant
#     (bin/fm-wake-grant.sh), runs one bounded headless engine turn
#     (bin/fm-supervision-engine-lib.sh) with the generated branch prompt
#     (bin/fm-branch-prompt.sh) and the away tail, releases the branch's
#     leases and grant, and counts the wake handled only when that turn
#     exited cleanly, recorded a durable report (bin/fm-branch-report.sh), and
#     left none of its granted rows in the wake queue. A handled wake - a
#     routine or a captain outcome alike - never wakes main: captain outcomes
#     wait in the outcome store for the return brief. It then parks on the
#     successor.
# Every other outcome exits with the close's own reason line plus one
# "supervision-host:" line saying why main has this wake, after stopping the
# successor cycle so main's next turn end starts from the same state as
# without the host. Whenever the captain returned during an engine turn that
# recorded outcomes, handled or not, the return brief was rendered before they
# existed, so the host exits with the close, one "supervision-host:" line
# naming them, and one line per outcome, for main to relay. The host injects
# nothing and has no delivery path of its own; the owner's existing wake path
# is the only way main hears from it. That handoff is only a prompt: each
# outcome recorded after the return is already a durable queued wake
# (bin/fm-branch-report.sh), so it still reaches main when the host dies at the
# turn's end or its owner drops the handoff, as a superseded Cursor park does.
#
# THE PARK BOUNDARY. Claude drops the exit 2 of a Stop hook it terminated at
# the hook's configured timeout (docs/verification/supervision.md), Cursor's
# stop hook carries the same tracked 28800-second registration, and a host
# that handles its own wakes is not shortened by them, so the host ends its
# own park before that timeout: after FM_SUPERVISION_HOST_PARK_SECONDS (default
# 27000, under the tracked 28800-second registration) it stops this home's
# watcher and exits with one "supervision-host: cycle boundary" line, which the
# owner delivers as an ordinary wake; main drains, acknowledges, and ends its
# turn, and that turn end starts the next park. The boundary is checked on
# every loop pass, however many closes are already waiting, and an away close
# whose engine turn could still be running at the turn limit (the turn bound
# plus the engine grace), judged when the close arrives and again just before
# the turn starts, is not handled: the host exits through the same boundary
# with that close printed ahead of the line. The turn limit is the boundary
# itself unless the owner sets FM_SUPERVISION_HOST_PARK_LIMIT later: Codex's
# checkpoint, whose bound is the park itself rather than a harness timeout,
# lets a turn that starts before the boundary finish after it.
#
# OWNERSHIP. Before activation, every successor cycle, and every engine turn
# the host proves this session still holds the fleet lock
# (bin/fm-session-lock-lib.sh) and, when launched by the auto-arm, that the
# auto-arm generation it serves (FM_SUPERVISION_HOST_AUTOARM_GEN owned by
# FM_SUPERVISION_HOST_OWNER_PID) is still current; otherwise it stands down
# with a "supervision-host:" line and leaves the decision to its owner; a
# host that stands down before activation leaves the owner's host record,
# processes, arms, and leases alone. The engine runs with
# FM_SUPERVISION_ACTOR=branch, the session-lock holder as FM_LEASE_HOLDER_PID,
# the primary's harness pin, and this turn's report id, so every guarded
# script applies the same partition, leases, and away relocation it applies to
# the Pi branch. At activation the host stops anything a crashed predecessor
# left running (recorded with identities, never by name), including the
# engine descendants its turn recorded, removes that turn's files, and
# releases the branch actor's leases; it releases them again after every
# engine turn.
#
# STATE (all under state/, owned here): .supervision-host (this host's pid and
# the processes it runs), .supervision-host-engine (the engine conversation:
# engine, model, session id, main-session key, turn count, running cost),
# .supervision-host-turn and .supervision-host-receipts (the current turn's
# report scope and the reports it recorded), .supervision-host-prompt and
# .supervision-host-wake (the prompt and wake text of the current turn), and
# .supervision-host.log (a bounded ledger of where every close went, with each
# engine turn's usage and outcome).
#
# Tunables (environment): FM_SUPERVISION_HOST_PARK_SECONDS (27000; a positive
# integer below the 28800-second registration, any other value is the default),
# FM_SUPERVISION_HOST_PARK_LIMIT (the park boundary; a later value below the
# registration lets turns run past the boundary up to it, any other value is
# the boundary), FM_SUPERVISION_HOST_TURN_TIMEOUT (1200), FM_SUPERVISION_HOST_ROTATE_TURNS (20:
# a new engine conversation after this many turns; every main session start
# also opens a new one), FM_SUPERVISION_HOST_READY_TIMEOUT (25: how long a
# successor cycle may take to verify), FM_SUPERVISION_HOST_POLL (1).
