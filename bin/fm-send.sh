#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Send one line of literal text to a crewmate endpoint, then Enter.
# Usage: fm-send.sh <target> [--resolve-key <key>]... <text...>
#   <target> may be an exact task id, a legacy fm-<id> task label resolved
#   through this home's state/<id>.meta, or an explicit well-formed backend
#   target. fm-send refuses unresolved guesses rather than falling back to a
#   tmux window search, because a "successful" send to the wrong endpoint is
#   worse than a loud failure.
# Special keys instead of text: fm-send.sh <target> --key Enter
# Key support is backend-specific: tmux/herdr support Escape, Enter, and C-c;
# Orca currently supports Enter and C-c only, and rejects Escape.
#
# Text submission is verified: the line is typed ONCE, then Enter is sent and
# retried (Enter only, never retyped) until the target backend confirms a
# submit or reports an inconclusive send. If a swallowed Enter is positively
# confirmed, fm-send exits NON-ZERO so the caller knows the steer did not land
# instead of silently leaving an unsubmitted instruction.
# Submission dispatches through the target's recorded backend; the tmux adapter
# shares its composer/submit core with the away-mode daemon via bin/fm-tmux-lib.sh.
# Tune with FM_SEND_RETRIES (default 3) / FM_SEND_SLEEP (0.4).
# Slash commands, and codex `$...` skill invocations resolved through harness
# meta, get a longer pre-Enter settle so completion popups do not swallow Enter.
#
# From-firstmate marker: when the resolved target is a task selector whose meta
# records kind=secondmate, the text uses the live-charter-compatible
# from-firstmate carrier owned by bin/fm-operational-input.sh so the secondmate
# routes its reply via its status file or a status-pointed doc instead of
# stranding it in chat the main firstmate never reads. A crewmate/scout target,
# an explicit backend-target escape-hatch target, and the --key path are never
# marked - their behavior is unchanged.
#
# Parent-owned pending-reply expectation: every newly marked secondmate request
# also receives a privacy-safe correlation id and a durable parent record under
# state/pending-replies/ before delivery (bin/fm-pending-reply-lib.sh). Delivery
# success and reply success are separate facts: a successful submit never
# resolves the expectation. Set FM_PENDING_REPLY_EXISTING_CORR=<id> when
# re-sending a recovery request for an already-open expectation so a second
# record is not created. Direct unmarked captain input never creates one.
#
# Decision closure (answerer-closes): pass --resolve-key <key> (repeatable,
# before the message) when this send answers an open keyed needs-decision: or
# blocked: record in the target task's state/<id>.status. After the submit is
# confirmed, fm-send itself appends the closing
# "resolved [key=<key>]: answered: <capped excerpt>" line to that status file,
# so the captain-facing OPEN DECISIONS record closes at answer time and never
# depends on the busy worker writing a matching resolved line. The close is a
# LOCAL append for every target kind - crewmate, scout, local secondmate, and
# remote secondmate alike - because the open-decision ledger fm-wake-drain
# folds lives in this home's own state dir (a remote mate's escalations reach
# it through the parent-replies ingest); only the answer message crosses the
# backend or remote transport. Each named key must currently be open in that
# ledger per status_open_decisions (bin/fm-classify-lib.sh) or fm-send refuses
# before sending, so a mistyped key cannot deliver an answer while silently
# orphaning the decision. A failed or unconfirmed send never closes a key; a
# delivered answer whose closing append fails exits nonzero with the exact
# manual close command, leaving the decision open to re-surface (the safe
# direction). A send without the flag never closes anything: a routine steer,
# working:, or done: event still cannot clear a captain decision. The flag is
# refused with --key, with an explicit backend target (no task ledger in this
# home), and with an empty message.
#
# After a successful text submit fm-send pauses FM_SEND_SETTLE seconds (default 1,
# 0 disables) before returning: submit confirmation only proves the text was
# accepted, but the harness needs a beat to spin up the turn before its busy
# footer appears, so an immediate peek would otherwise see the stale idle pane.
# The pause is fm-send-only; the shared submit core (used by the away-mode daemon,
# which only needs "submitted") does not pay it, and the --key path is unaffected.
