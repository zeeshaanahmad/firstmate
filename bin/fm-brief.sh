# Scaffold a crewmate brief or persistent secondmate charter at
# data/<task-id>/brief.md under the active firstmate home.
# For ordinary tasks, the standard Setup/Rules/Definition-of-done contract is
# filled in. Ship and scout `# Task` sections have two subsections Firstmate
# fills before dispatch: `{TASK}` under `## Captain's intent` (the captain's
# own ask plus the context needed to read it, including the substance of any
# report, decision, or PR the ask refers to, without added speaker labels or
# direct address) and `{FIRSTMATE_SPEC}`
# under `## Firstmate spec` (build instructions, which are never the captain's
# intent). bin/fm-dod-lib.sh owns the no-mistakes `--intent` contract those
# subsections feed; bin/fm-spawn.sh refuses leftover placeholders and a
# `## Captain's intent` line opening with a Captain label or address. Secondmate
# charters still use a single `{TASK}` charter fill. Firstmate may adjust other
# sections when the task genuinely deviates (e.g. working an existing external
# PR instead of shipping a new one).
# Usage: fm-brief.sh <task-id> <repo-name> --mode <no-mistakes|direct-PR|local-only> [--branch-prefix <prefix>] [--forge <none|gerrit> [--shape squash]] [--herdr-lab]
#        fm-brief.sh <task-id> <repo-name> --scout [--herdr-lab]
#        fm-brief.sh <task-id> --secondmate {<project>...|--no-projects}
#   --scout writes the scout contract instead: the deliverable is a report at
#   data/<task-id>/report.md (no branch, no push, no PR) and the worktree is scratch.
#   It offers the Lavish review loop only when `fm-bootstrap.sh lavish-compatible`
#   confirms the supported lavish-axi floor; otherwise it asks for a text report.
#   --secondmate writes a persistent secondmate charter. The project list
#   is cloned into the secondmate home, while the natural-language scope
#   tells the main firstmate when to route work there; routine churn stays in its own home;
#   captain-relevant escalations and marked from-firstmate replies append to this
#   home's status file.
#   --no-projects writes a project-less charter for a domain whose subject is the
#   firstmate repo itself (its home is a firstmate worktree, its crews take pooled
#   worktrees of the same repo). It is mutually exclusive with a project list, and
#   omitting both still fails loudly so an accidental omission is never silent.
#   Set FM_SECONDMATE_CHARTER='<charter>' to fill the charter text.
#   Set FM_SECONDMATE_SCOPE='<scope>' to write a routing scope distinct from the charter text.
#   --herdr-lab is mandatory when the task will issue Herdr lifecycle commands.
#   It adds the hard isolation contract backed by bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh.
#   The flag must be explicit because {TASK} and {FIRSTMATE_SPEC} are filled
#   after scaffolding and the caller-supplied repo string cannot reliably
#   identify this repo. Briefs made without it carry a loud declaration so an
#   omitted contract cannot be silent.
# For ship tasks, --mode is REQUIRED and shapes the definition of done. Firstmate
# resolves it per task at intake (AGENTS.md section 7); data/projects.md holds the
# captain's standing posture as context, and this script never reads it:
#   no-mistakes  implement -> /no-mistakes pipeline -> PR -> configured merge authority
#   direct-PR    implement -> push + open PR via gh-axi (no pipeline) -> configured merge authority
#   local-only   implement on branch, stop and report "ready in branch" (no push/PR);
#                the configured merge authority approves, firstmate merges to local main
# no-mistakes-prod-only is a registry policy, not a task mode; resolve it to one of
# the three concrete modes at intake before calling this script.
# --branch-prefix <prefix> optionally overrides the ship branch's "fm/" prefix, so
# the resolved branch is "<prefix><task-id>" instead of the default "fm/<task-id>".
# Pass an empty prefix ("--branch-prefix ''") for a bare "<task-id>" branch, or a
# conventional prefix such as "fix/" - useful for a third-party project that does
# not use this tooling and should not see an "fm/"-branded branch or PR. Defaults
# to "fm/" when omitted, so every existing installation's branch names are
# unchanged. Like --mode, this script never reads data/projects.md for it: the
# registry's optional "branch=<prefix>" annotation (bin/fm-project-mode.sh's
# header owns that format and its --branch-prefix query) is the captain's
# standing per-project preference, and firstmate resolves it per task at intake
# and passes the explicit flag. Refused on --scout and --secondmate: a scout
# makes no branch and a charter is not a delivery contract.
# --forge names the project's forge, defaults to none, and is orthogonal to --mode
# exactly as the registry's `forge=` token is. It is the captain's confirmed
# registry binding, read from data/projects.md at intake and passed here; this
# script never infers a forge and never looks the binding up, and bin/fm-spawn.sh
# refuses a brief whose forge disagrees with the registry. bin/fm-project-mode.sh's
# header owns what the binding means, and bin/fm-dod-lib.sh owns what `gerrit`
# changes for the worker. A forge on --mode local-only is refused, because that
# mode publishes nothing.
# --shape names how a forge=gerrit task is published, and only `squash` - one
# change - is accepted: `stack` is refused until a stack can be watched by its
# membership pinned when its watch is armed, because the merge watch follows one
# change.
# It defaults to squash on gerrit and is refused without it.
# The generated ship brief records the chosen mode as a fixed machine-readable
# "Delivery contract: mode=<mode>" line, followed by " forge=gerrit shape=squash"
# on that forge. bin/fm-spawn.sh reads that line and refuses to launch a ship task
# whose explicit --mode or registered forge disagrees, so an adjusted brief and the
# recorded task metadata cannot drift apart.
# Ship briefs begin with a worktree-isolation assertion before the branch step.
# Both crewmate scaffolds carry one shared rule against administering the
# infrastructure every lane shares - the no-mistakes daemon and the worktree pool
# their own slot came from - so ship and scout cannot drift apart. A secondmate
# charter omits it: that home allocates and returns slots for its own crewmates.
# --mode, --forge, and --shape are refused on scout and secondmate scaffolds: a
# scout's deliverable is a report rather than a merge, and a charter is not a
# delivery contract.
# There is no --yolo flag here. The worker never owns merge decisions, so yolo is
# a spawn-time and firstmate-side input only (AGENTS.md section 7).
# Every scaffold's status protocol distinguishes the configured
# declared-external-wait verb (FM_CLASSIFY_PAUSED_VERB, default "paused") from
# "blocked:": pause for a known external wait expected to clear on its own,
# blocked when firstmate must act.
# Emission-time syntax and legacy unknown-time handling are owned by
# bin/fm-classify-lib.sh; each scaffold renders the stamp as a literal <epoch>
# placeholder the worker replaces with a numeric Unix time as it appends, so a
# scaffold never emits a substitution a file-write tool would copy through.
# Every scaffold also carries the steering-inbox receive-and-ack section:
# process state/<id>.inbox/*.msg in order and acknowledge each by moving it to
# handled/ (record, doorbell, and ladder owned by bin/fm-task-inbox-lib.sh).
# Ship tasks include a project-memory section so durable project-intrinsic
# learnings can be committed to AGENTS.md through the project's delivery path;
# it carries the AGENTS.md authoring bar (widely useful knowledge only, pointers
# over copied detail) and defers self-governance recognition and insertion to
# fm-ensure-agents-md.sh's contract.
# Scaffolds carry no role scope: fm-spawn.sh supplies fm_brief_worker_role from
# fm-dod-lib.sh to every ship/scout launch brief, so this file never becomes a
# second owner of a contract that must stay current across relaunches.
# A home may carry standing worker instructions without editing this tracked
# script: when config/brief-include.md exists under the active home, ship and
# scout scaffolds append its text verbatim as their last section, "# Home brief
# additions", which defers to every other section of the brief. It goes last
# because the machine-read `# Task` heading resolves to its first match, so
# appended text can never shadow it; a later scout promotion appends its ship
# contract below it, which that position-free deference already covers. An
# absent or blank file changes nothing; a present path that is not a readable
# regular file, or text carrying its own "Delivery contract: mode=" line (which
# a later scout promotion could not outrank), stops the scaffold before
# anything is written. Secondmate charters never take it.
# Refuses to overwrite an existing brief.

When a terminal message says an instruction is waiting there - and at any natural checkpoint when you are unsure - list $INBOX_DIR/*.msg, read and act on each message in numeric order, then acknowledge each handled message by moving it: \`mv $INBOX_DIR/NNN.msg $INBOX_DIR/handled/\`.
The move IS the acknowledgement: without it firstmate rings again and eventually treats you as stuck. An empty or absent inbox needs no action.

# Project clones
$PROJECT_CLONES_BODY

# Operating model
You are in an isolated firstmate home. The local \`AGENTS.md\` is your job description, and your local \`data/\`, \`state/\`, \`config/\`, and \`projects/\` dirs are yours to operate.
$PROJECT_CLONES_NOTE
Delegate project work to your own crewmates with the normal firstmate lifecycle: brief, spawn, status, watcher, steer, teardown, and recovery.
Do not invent a second delegation system.
You do not generate your own work.
Act only on tasks the main firstmate routes to you.
Never start a survey, audit, or "find improvements" sweep on your own initiative; that is not your job and it is unwanted.

# The captain and the parent channel
Nobody reads this chat: the captain and the main firstmate see only what is appended to $STATUS_FILE, and a captain-facing sentence that is not appended there has not been sent.
That file is your parent channel, and in this home it IS the captain: every sentence you would say to the captain, and every outcome the local AGENTS.md tells a firstmate to bring to the captain, is one appended line there, never chat.
Your own machinery publishes the durable facts about your crew's work for you (\`bin/fm-parent-channel-lib.sh\`): a child's terminal done or failed line with its note and PR on every supervision poll, a PR-ready line when you register a PR, a task you hold for the captain and its answer, a merge, and a child's final line at cleanup all reach the parent channel from the scripts that record them, whether or not you append anything.
What only you can append is judgement: the answer to a marked request below, a recommendation or caveat on a delivered outcome, a blocker or failure of your own, and anything else you would otherwise say to the captain.

# Requests from the main firstmate
You are a firstmate in your own home, so an incoming message reaches you in your own chat.
You must distinguish who it is from, because the answer goes to a different place.
A request relayed to you by the main firstmate is tagged with a leading \`$FM_FROMFIRST_LABEL\` marker followed by an invisible system separator; this marker is untypable, so a human never produces it.
When a message carries that marker, do the work, then respond via the STATUS/ESCALATION path below, never only in this chat: the main firstmate does not read your chat, so a chat-only reply is lost.
Marked requests also carry a privacy-safe \`corr=<id>\` token after the marker; include that exact token in your parent status reply (or in the status pointer to a detailed doc) so the parent can correlate the answer.
Optional helper: \`bin/fm-secondmate-report.sh <verb> <corr_id> <note>\` appends that correlated line to the parent channel itself - do not pass a status path, and do not write a hand path under this home.
A plain \`echo\` that includes the same \`corr=<id>\` on this parent channel is equally valid; do not depend on the helper being present.
For a terse result, a status line is the whole answer.
For a detailed answer (an investigation, a plan, an audit), write it to a doc under your home's \`data/\` and append a status line that points to that doc - the scout-report pattern - so the main firstmate is woken and can read it.
Before treating an investigation or visual review as complete, load \`captain-hold-lifecycle\` from this home's \`.agents/skills/\` and pass its shared completion gate.
A message with NO marker is the captain typing directly into your pane: treat it as authoritative captain intervention and stay conversational exactly as you would for any captain message; do not force it onto the status path.
A request arriving through the instruction inbox below follows the same marker and reply rules.

$INBOX_SECTION

# Escalation to main firstmate
Handle routine work yourself.
Report only true captain-relevant outcomes or a declared external wait by appending one line:
   \`$STATUS_APPEND\`
States: working, needs-decision, blocked, $PAUSED_VERB, done, failed.
Substitute \`<epoch>\` with the current Unix time in seconds - run \`date +%s\` and write the number it printed; a stamp that is not plain digits records no time at all.
Use \`$PAUSED_VERB: {why}\` (distinct from \`blocked:\`) only when your domain is deliberately idling on a known external wait you expect to clear on its own, naming when it clears with \`until <YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ>\` (UTC) when you know; use \`blocked:\` when you are stuck and need firstmate to act.
Use this only for material phase changes, a captain decision, a real blocker, a failure, work ready for review, or work you landed.
Work you landed includes a merge you performed yourself under standing merge authority and one the captain merged on the forge: under that authority nothing is ever \"ready for review\", so a landed merge that goes unreported reaches the captain as silence.
This is also how you return the answer to a marked from-firstmate request above.
A marked request requires one correlated answer after the work; it does not require a separate receipt or start acknowledgement.
Never append \`working:\` merely to acknowledge receipt or announce that a marked request has started.
When a routed-work phase has a supervisor-actionable material change worth reporting under the rule above, give that reported phase a stable key.
If its first reportable event is \`working [key=<work-slug>]: {material phase}\`, use the same key on its later \`$PAUSED_VERB\`, \`done\`, \`failed\`, \`needs-decision\`, or \`blocked\` event so the earlier working phase is superseded.
When a keyed phase ends without another reportable state, append \`resolved [key=<work-slug>] [at=<epoch>]: {why it is no longer active}\`.
\`resolved\` separately closes an escalated decision or blocker, and only a \`resolved\` line carrying that decision's exact key closes it: a later \`done\` or \`working\` event never does, even when the answer is what started that work.
The main firstmate's answer normally writes that closing line at answer time; when a blocker or wait clears WITHOUT an answer from the main firstmate, append \`resolved [at=<epoch>]: {how it cleared}\` yourself (keyed with \`[key=<slug>]\` if you opened it with one) as your domain resumes.
Routine internal supervision, heartbeats, retries, and crewmate churn stay inside your own home and must not touch that status file.

# Definition of done
You are persistent by default. Do not exit just because your queue is empty.
On startup and restart, run normal firstmate bootstrap and recovery through \`bin/fm-session-start.sh\` for your own home, but only to RECONCILE work that is already yours: in-flight crewmates, tracked backlog items, and durable watches recorded in this home.
When you have no assigned or in-flight work after that reconciliation, go idle and wait silently for the main firstmate to route you a task.
An empty queue is a healthy resting state, not a cue to invent work: never spawn a survey, audit, or any self-directed "find work" task on your own initiative.
If this charter cannot be carried out, append \`blocked [at=<epoch>]: {why}\` or \`failed [at=<epoch>]: {why}\` to the main status file and stop.

7. Never administer infrastructure that every lane shares. Two things are shared:
   - The `no-mistakes` daemon - one instance serving every lane/home, so stopping, restarting, or
     updating it kills other lanes' in-flight pipeline runs; only firstmate manages the daemon.
     Before you append `blocked:` about the pipeline, run `no-mistakes daemon status` and
     `no-mistakes axi status`. If the daemon socket refuses connections or is missing, append
     `blocked [at=<epoch>]: {the daemon error}` and stop even when the local run record still says running or
     fixing, because that record can be stale after the daemon exits. A run record failed with a
     daemon error is also a real block.
     Only after ruling out socket refusal, if the run is still running or fixing, reattach and keep
     going. A drive-call error, timeout, slow read, or generic unreachability is NOT a daemon error:
     the daemon accepts `respond` immediately and runs the round in the background, so a killed or
     timed-out call was only waiting for a read while the run kept working.
   - The worktree pool your own worktree came from, and the repository every lane's worktree
     shares. Never create, remove, return, prune, move, or reassign a worktree or pool slot, and
     never write into a sibling slot's directory. Rule 2 does not cover this: removing a worktree
     is administration rather than an edit outside your directory, and it lands on lanes that are
     running right now. The act is the rule and commands are only examples of it - `treehouse`
     get/return/remove/prune, the equivalent operations on any other worktree provider or runtime
     backend, and `git worktree add|remove|move|prune`. A slot that looks unused is not evidence
     that it is free, and returning your own worktree is firstmate's job at cleanup, not yours.
   If you genuinely need a second checkout, another slot, or the daemon touched, append
   `blocked [at=<epoch>]: {what you need}` and stop; firstmate arranges it.

$TASK_SECTION

$HERDR_SECTION

# Setup
You are in a disposable git worktree of $REPO, at a detached HEAD on a clean default branch.
This is a SCOUT task: the deliverable is a written report, not a PR.
The worktree is your laboratory - install, run, edit, and make scratch commits freely; all of it is discarded at teardown.
The report is the only thing that survives, so anything worth keeping must be in it.

# Rules
1. Never push to any remote and never open a PR.
2. Stay inside this worktree; the only files you may write outside it are the report and the status file below.
3. Use gh-axi for GitHub operations and chrome-devtools-axi for browser operations.
4. Report status by appending one line:
   \`$STATUS_APPEND\`
   States: working, needs-decision, blocked, $PAUSED_VERB, done, failed.
   Substitute \`<epoch>\` with the current Unix time in seconds - run \`date +%s\` and write the number it printed; a stamp that is not plain digits records no time at all.
   Each append wakes firstmate, so report sparingly: only phase changes a supervisor
   would act on and the needs-decision/blocked/paused/done/failed states. No step-by-step
   FYI progress lines; firstmate reads your pane for that.
   Whenever you mention a PR anywhere - a status line, your terminal, a summary - write its full
   https:// URL exactly as the forge printed it, never a bare number such as "PR 108"; firstmate
   copies that URL from your line rather than assembling one.
   Use \`$PAUSED_VERB: {why}\` - distinct from \`blocked:\` - ONLY when you are deliberately idling on a
   known external wait you expect to clear on its own ($CREWMATE_PAUSE_WAIT_EXAMPLES):
   firstmate then leaves your idle pane alone and rechecks it on a long cadence instead of
   treating it as a possible wedge. When you know when the wait clears, say so in the line with
   \`until <YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MMZ>\` (UTC) and firstmate rechecks at that time instead.
   Use \`blocked:\` when you are stuck and need help.
5. If you hit the same obstacle twice, append \`blocked [at=<epoch>]: {why}\` and stop; firstmate will help.
6. If a decision belongs to a human (product choices, destructive actions),
   append \`needs-decision [at=<epoch>]: {summary of options}\` and stop. Firstmate will reply with the decision.
   A decision or blocker you opened stays open until a \`resolved\` line carrying its exact key lands; a later \`done:\` or \`working:\` line never closes it, even when the answer is what started that work.
   Firstmate's reply normally writes that closing line at answer time; when a blocker or wait clears WITHOUT a firstmate reply, append \`resolved [at=<epoch>]: {how it cleared}\` yourself (same \`[key=<slug>]\` if you opened it with one) as you resume.

# Definition of done
Write your findings to \`$DATA/$ID/report.md\`.
The report must stand alone: what you did, what you found, the evidence (commands run, output, file:line references), and what you recommend.
$LAVISH_LINE
Before reporting done, read and follow \`$FM_ROOT/.agents/skills/captain-hold-lifecycle/SKILL.md\` and pass its shared completion gate for the report and any visual review.
When the report is complete, append \`done [at=<epoch>]: {one-line conclusion}\` to the status file and stop.
If your findings reveal work that should ship (e.g. you reproduced a bug and the fix is clear), say so in the report; firstmate may promote this task in place, and you would then receive mode-specific ship instructions as a follow-up message.

# Setup
You are in a disposable git worktree of $REPO, at a detached HEAD on a clean default branch.

**Verify isolation before anything else.** Run \`pwd -P\` and \`git rev-parse --show-toplevel\`; both must resolve to the disposable task worktree you were launched in, such as a treehouse pool path or an Orca-managed worktree, not the primary checkout firstmate operates from.
The path check is authoritative: \`git rev-parse --git-dir\` and \`git rev-parse --git-common-dir\` can help inspect the repo, but they do not prove you are outside the primary checkout.
If the top-level path is the primary checkout or not the worktree you were launched in, STOP - do not branch or commit here - append \`blocked [at=<epoch>]: launched in primary checkout, not an isolated worktree\` to the status file and stop.
