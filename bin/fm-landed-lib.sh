# Shared "what belongs in Recently Landed" rule.
# Usage: . bin/fm-landed-lib.sh; splice "$FM_LANDED_JQ_DEFS" ahead of a jq
# program, then select backlog rows with `landed_record`.
#
# ONE OWNER for the landed selector. Recently Landed is assembled from two
# separate jq programs - bin/fm-bearings-snapshot.sh projects this home's own
# Done rows, and bin/fm-fleet-snapshot.sh projects each secondmate home's Done
# rows into the roll-up that the same section merges in. Both answer the one
# question "is this closed row a delivery the captain should see", so the rule
# lives here and neither program restates it.
#
# A closed row is never actively held: tasks-axi clears the held flag when a
# task closes, but a non-release answer keeps hold-kind and the hold reason.
# Merge approval removes those annotations through the release contract before
# cleanup records the merged PR or local-only landing, so either artifact on a
# Done captain-hold row is not a delivery. A scout's recorded report is its
# delivery regardless of release state or other links in its title.
#
# The distinction that decides the section is delivery: Recently Landed is
# merged PRs, completed scouts, and finished local-only merges. A closed row
# whose artifact matches its merged or done completion verb is a delivery only
# when it retains no captain-question provenance. A retained scout is identified
# by its kind and recorded report because its title links do not change what it
# delivers. A captain question remains kind captain when it closes, so it is
# never rendered as shipped work even when its text names an artifact.
# A local-only completion is a delivery whether or not its row carries a kind.
# The retained hold-kind alone keeps answered calls out of the section.
# Merged PRs and reported scouts remain distinct.
#
# The backlog-selection compatibility fallback keeps a structured Done row
# whose three parsed artifact fields are absent when it does not retain
# hold-kind captain.
# That preserves kindless rows closed before artifact-aware selection without
# admitting answered captain calls or explicit reportless scouts.
# Already-selected v1 secondmate landed rows may omit kind. For those rows,
# landed_artifact preserves a report_path with a reported completion; this
# display compatibility does not admit kindless reports from raw backlog rows.
# tests/fm-bearings-snapshot.test.sh covers both fresh and cached v1 summaries.

# shellcheck disable=SC2034 # Output global, read by the sourcing caller.
