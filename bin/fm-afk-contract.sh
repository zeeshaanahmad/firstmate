# fm-afk-contract.sh - the one owner of the away-posture record: its schema, the
# mandate-clause fields and their structural check, refusal naming the missing
# part, the read-back rendering, the entry announcement, and the archive at return.
#
# POSTURE. Away mode is a posture of the one supervision session, recorded in
# state/.afk-contract and never inferred from chat. While the record exists the
# home is afk; the captain's first unmarked message archives it (the return path
# in bin/fm-afk-return.sh calls `archive` through bin/fm-afk-launch.sh stop).
# Being away changes how the captain is informed and what happens at a
# captain-owned decision point, never the authority set. Hold-for-return is the
# only reach profile this release records: there is no phone channel, and the
# entry announcement says so every time.
#
# RECORD (state/.afk-contract; written only by this script; YAML-shaped so a
# human can read it, but parsed only here - consumers use the read subcommands):
#   version: 1
#   entered: <UTC ISO 8601>
#   entered_epoch: <seconds>
#   expected_return: <UTC ISO 8601> | -
#   reach_channels: none
#   reach_announced: <the one-sentence reach announcement>
#   spend_max_concurrent_workers: <n>
#   merge_grants: - |            task ids that may merge while this record exists
#     - <task-id>                (empty is `merge_grants: -`; a missing field on
#     ...                        a pre-field v1 record reads as an empty list)
#   confirmed: <UTC ISO 8601>
#   confirmed_epoch: <seconds>
#   words: | or |-                 the captain's words, verbatim, never edited,
#     <line>                       one record line per input line (or `words: -`
#     ...                          when /afk carried no words); `|` retains a
#                                  final newline and `|-` records its absence
#   clauses:                       accepted clauses, recorded from the fields given
#     - id: <input ordinal>
#       action: <verb>
#       object: e:<reversible escaped text>
#       when: e:<reversible escaped precondition>
#       stop: e:<reversible escaped text> | -
#       flag: <never-set concept the best-effort scan matched> | -
#   refused:                       clauses missing a part, with the part named
#     - id: <input ordinal>
#       text: e:<the fields as given, reversibly escaped>
#       missing: <part - reason>
# A proposal (state/.afk-contract.proposed) has the same shape without the
# confirmed fields; confirmation stamps the first entry time. Archived final
# records live under state/afk-contracts/ as <entered_epoch>.afk-contract, and
# replaced mandates use <entered_epoch>-superseded-<confirmed_epoch>.afk-contract.
# A replacement carries the original session entry forward as the phase-1
# fail-safe. Durable archive-chain identity and same-second session identity are
# deferred to phase 4 (fm-afk-clauses-execute-r1).
#
# CLAUSE FIELDS. A clause is given as explicit fields, one clause per --action:
#   --action <verb> --object <text> --when <text> [--stop <text>]
#   action  one of: merge land prerelease install rerun dispatch abort-run answer
#           discard wake-me. A new verb is a code change here, never a prompt change.
#   object  the thing the clause acts on, in the captain's words, verbatim.
#   when    the stated precondition, in the captain's words, verbatim.
#   stop    optional: what ends the clause early, verbatim.
# NO STATIC NATURAL-LANGUAGE PARSER EXISTS HERE, BY THE CAPTAIN'S MANDATE. The
# object and precondition text are recorded exactly as given and are never
# tokenized, classified, or semantically validated by this script; whether a
# precondition holds is the supervision session's judgment at execution time
# in a later phase. The structural check asserts only that the action, object,
# and precondition fields are present, and that the action is a listed verb.
# THE NEVER-SET SCAN is only a coarse best-effort structural FLAG, never a
# refusal and never the authoritative gate: a clause whose fields mention a
# listed never-set concept is still recorded, with `flag:` naming the concept
# so the read-back and the return brief show it. The scan matches a listed term
# exactly or with a plain inflection (s, es, d, ed, ing, er, ers) at
# punctuation-delimited token boundaries, so an unrelated name such as
# ping-service or tokenize-worker is never flagged, and it can miss spellings,
# with joined compounds such as oneTimeCode a known limitation. Authoritative
# never-set and forbidden-action enforcement is the supervision session's
# judgment at execution time in phase 4.
# A clause missing a required field is refused with that field named, recorded
# under refused:, read back beside the accepted list, and never executes. Ids
# are the input ordinals across accepted and refused clauses.
# THIS RELEASE RECORDS CLAUSES AND DOES NOT EXECUTE THEM: the guarded gates learn
# to cite a clause in a later phase, and the announcement and return brief both
# say so, so a recorded clause is never mistaken for a promise.
# HARD RULE: forbidden, destructive, irreversible, and security-sensitive actions
# are never pre-authorizable regardless of clause text, and no recorded clause is
# authority by itself.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-afk-contract.sh propose [--words-file <path> | --words <text>]
#       [--action <verb> --object <text> --when <text> [--stop <text>]]...
#       [--expected-return <UTC ISO 8601>] [--spend <n>] [--grant <task-id>]...
#     Compile and write the proposal, then print the read-back. Exit 0 with every
#     clause accepted, 3 when at least one clause was refused (the read-back names
#     the missing part), and 2 on a usage error. --words-file keeps the file's
#     bytes verbatim, trailing newlines included. A refused clause remains in the
#     proposal so the captain can restate it before saying go. Repeatable --grant
#     records captain-named task ids that may merge-when-green while the record
#     exists; invalid or duplicate ids are a usage error, never a refused clause.
#   fm-afk-contract.sh confirm
#     Promote the proposal into the record with the confirmed timestamp and
#     print the entry announcement. A proposal is required when no confirmed
#     record exists; an existing record with no proposal is a no-op refresh.
#     A replacement is staged before the prior record is archived and replaced.
#   fm-afk-contract.sh readback [--proposal]
#   fm-afk-contract.sh field <name> [--proposal]
#   fm-afk-contract.sh words [--proposal | --path <record>]
#   fm-afk-contract.sh clauses [--proposal | --path <record>]   TSV: id action object when stop
#   fm-afk-contract.sh flags [--proposal | --path <record>]     TSV: id concept (flagged clauses only)
#   fm-afk-contract.sh validate [--proposal | --path <record>]  exit 0 when the record is readable and, for a record, confirmed
#     Backslashes and control whitespace in TSV fields use reversible escapes
#     (`\\`, `\t`, `\r`, and `\n`) so every record remains one row per clause;
#     a literal `-` is `\x2d` to distinguish it from the empty-stop marker.
#   fm-afk-contract.sh refused [--proposal | --path <record>]   TSV: id text missing
#   fm-afk-contract.sh grants [--proposal | --path <record>]    one task id per line
#   fm-afk-contract.sh archive              move the record aside; print its path
#   fm-afk-contract.sh archived <entered_epoch>   print that archived record's path
#
# CROSS-SUBSYSTEM LOCK (state/.afk-contract.lock; this script is its one owner).
# This record is authority another subsystem reads and then ACTS on outside this
# script: bin/fm-pr-merge.sh reads the merge grants and afterwards hands a merge
# to the forge. A publication, replacement, or archive landing between that read
# and the forge handoff would land a merge on authority that no longer holds, so
# the two subsystems share one lock instead of each locking its own records: the
# record-mutating subcommands (confirm, archive) hold it across their mutation,
# and a reader that acts on the record holds it across both its read and that
# action (fm_afk_contract_lock_hold / fm_afk_contract_lock_release). The
# read-only subcommands never take it, so a holder can still read the record it
# locked. Neither side ever proceeds without it: the acquire is bounded, and a
# bound that is hit refuses and names the live holder rather than racing. That
# fixed bound is 120 seconds, sized so only a genuinely wedged holder trips it.
# A lock left by a killed process is reclaimed
# by the ordinary stale-owner recovery in bin/fm-wake-lib.sh, which owns the lock
# primitive itself.
#
# Sourceable: with the BASH_SOURCE guard, other scripts get the path, presence,
# and lock helpers (fm_afk_contract_path, fm_afk_contract_present,
# fm_afk_contract_proposal_path, fm_afk_contract_archive_dir,
# fm_afk_contract_lock_hold, fm_afk_contract_lock_release) without running main.
