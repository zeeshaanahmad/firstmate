# Single owner of a ship task's mode-specific "Definition of done" block and of
# the named-head reachability gate that accepts a ship `done:` claim.
# Sourced by bin/fm-brief.sh, which renders it into a generated ship brief, and by
# bin/fm-promote.sh, which renders it into the ship instructions a promoted scout
# receives. Both paths must hand the worker the same contract: a promoted
# no-mistakes worker that never received the ask-user escalation rule or the
# `--yes` ban is the exact delivery hole this single owner exists to close.
# fm_dod_block <no-mistakes|direct-PR|local-only> <task-id> [branch] [<forge>]
# prints the block on stdout with no trailing blank line. The caller validates the
# mode; an unknown mode is refused rather than silently rendered as the pipeline
# contract.
# The optional third argument is the task's full ship-branch name (a project's
# registered prefix may replace the legacy `fm/` one); it defaults to `fm/<task-id>`
# and is the immutable task branch rendered in every delivery contract.
# Callers of the gate are bin/fm-crew-state.sh (current-state done),
# bin/fm-pr-check.sh (PR registration), and bin/fm-inactive-reconcile.sh
# (secondmate ledger-first publish of a child done). A ship `done:` is not
# accepted while the named head exists only in the worker's disposable copy.
# The check tests that head, not whether some branch moved. In no-mistakes
# mode the pre-validation `done: {summary}` is the pipeline handoff and is
# not gated; only the later CI-ready `done: PR <url> checks green` is, or on a
# Gerrit project the later `done: PR <change url> published for review`. The
# named head is the worker copy's HEAD, except that a done naming the task's
# recorded pr= passes when the forge holds that head: a forge-reported
# pr_head= in no-mistakes mode, or a recorded merge
# (state/<id>.pr-poll-merge-notified). A push to Gerrit's refs/for/ leaves no
# ref a fetch can see, so a done naming a Gerrit change skips the remote-tracking
# reachability test entirely: it passes when that change is already the task's
# recorded pr=, which bin/fm-pr-check.sh writes only after this gate accepted it
# at arming, and otherwise only when a live read shows the change's current
# patch set carrying the worker copy's HEAD tree. A published-for-review report
# whose URL is not a canonical Gerrit change is refused outright. A squash is a new commit on the
# server's base, so the tree rather than the commit is what names the published
# content. In no-mistakes mode that live read is preceded by
# fm_dod_nm_custody_returned: a copy that publishes before recovering the
# pipeline's fix commits agrees with its own unfixed patch set, so the copy must
# also hold the result of a passed run. These live reads are the one check at the ready
# decision; a later rebase or patch set on the server does not revoke an armed
# task's done. Teardown's landed-work test remains the complete discard gate.
# The block opens with the fixed machine-readable "Delivery contract: mode=<mode>"
# line that bin/fm-spawn.sh checks a ship brief against; a forge=gerrit block
# appends " forge=gerrit shape=squash" to that line. The "Ship branch: <branch>"
# line under it is machine-readable the same way: bin/fm-spawn.sh refuses a ship
# whose spawn-selected branch disagrees with it.
# forge is none|gerrit and defaults to none; bin/fm-project-mode.sh's header owns
# what the registry binding means, and this file owns what gerrit changes for a
# WORKER (docs/gerrit-forge-integration.md is the design). A forge composes with
# the two modes that publish and is refused on local-only, which publishes
# nothing. On gerrit the worker publishes one squashed change with
# `gerrit-axi publish --squash` instead of opening a pull request: direct-PR does
# that straight away, and no-mistakes first runs the pipeline with its three
# forge-facing steps skipped and recovers the pipeline's own fix commits into its
# branch, because a passed run whose fixes stayed in the gate looks exactly like
# one whose fixes arrived and publishing it ships the unfixed code. Either mode's
# ready report is `done: PR <change url> published for review`; under
# no-mistakes a `note:` line listing each pipeline finding and its fix comes
# first, because the squash's description never shows the fix commits. A stack of
# changes is refused until it can be watched by its membership pinned when its
# watch is armed, because the merge poll watches one change. No contract here
# lets a worker submit, vote on, or abandon a change.
# The two PR-based blocks require a non-draft pull request before the done
# report, read back from the forge; a lane that deliberately holds a draft
# declares a paused wait instead. bin/fm-pr-check.sh refuses to arm merge
# monitoring on a draft through the same reading bin/fm-pr-merge.sh uses.
# This file is the one owner of the no-mistakes `--intent` contract: only the
# brief's `## Captain's intent` subsection plus later captain words, never
# `## Firstmate spec` and never the worker's own tradeoffs.
# Author the subsection body and later relays as the actual words, without
# adding speaker labels or direct address: the heading supplies provenance and
# is not part of --intent. A legacy mixed Task instead marks each captain line
# with `[captain] `; the selector returns its words, not that metadata prefix.
# That selector skips fenced blocks and indented examples like the heading
# reader, so a quoted `Captain:` sample is never authorized intent.
# Previously stored speaker labels remain readable for compatibility only.
# Never scrub literal examples or other content the captain actually supplied.
# The string passed must be self-sufficient - it plus the codebase reconstructs
# roughly the same specification - so a report, decision, or PR the intent
# refers to is written into it as substance, never left as a pointer.
# bin/fm-brief.sh scaffolds those two `# Task` subsections; bin/fm-spawn.sh and
# bin/fm-promote.sh refuse leftover `{TASK}` / `{FIRSTMATE_SPEC}` placeholders
# and a `## Captain's intent` line opening with a Captain label or address
# through the helpers below. Other mentions of `--intent` point here rather than
# restating the rule.
# Every heredoc here stays outside a command substitution: `VAR=$(cat <<EOF ...)`
# breaks parsing of the whole file on Bash 3.2 (tests/fm-brief.test.sh).
# fm_brief_worker_role owns the ship/scout role scope. bin/fm-spawn.sh is its one
# emitter, supplying it first in every ship/scout launch brief and never to a
# secondmate charter. It names the one task-owned steering inbox without
# relaxing isolation from every other home's endpoint namespace. Like
# fm_brief_intent_overlay it is a distinctly titled launch section that states
# its own precedence, so a brief or project instruction that authors a
# conflicting role is superseded rather than duplicated.
# fm_ship_rule_one owns the mode-specific first ship safety rule shared by an
# ordinary ship brief and the durable contract written during scout promotion.
# It takes the same optional trailing forge argument, because the rule that keeps
# a worker off a remote is exactly the rule that changes when the forge does.

You drive no-mistakes by responding to its gates, not by implementing fixes.
Follow the guidance no-mistakes itself provides for the mechanics: it loads when you invoke /no-mistakes, and \`no-mistakes axi run --help\` plus the \`help\` lines in each \`axi\` response are authoritative and version-matched to the installed binary.
When starting no-mistakes, pass \`--intent\` as only this brief's \`## Captain's intent\` subsection body, not its heading, plus any later words the captain actually said.
Preserve the actual words without adding speaker labels or direct address; the subsection heading supplies provenance outside the pipeline input.
For a legacy brief with no such subsection, include only words on lines marked \`[captain] \`, excluding that metadata prefix; never copy its mixed \`# Task\` wholesale.
If it has no provenance-marked captain words, stop and ask firstmate instead of starting no-mistakes.
Do not include \`## Firstmate spec\`, later Firstmate build constraints, or your own decisions and tradeoffs.
The \`--intent\` string you pass must be self-sufficient: that string plus the codebase must let a reader reconstruct roughly the same specification, without depending on a separate report, a PR, or context that lives only in this conversation.
When the captain's intent refers to a report, decision, or PR ("do items 1, 2, 3, and 7 of the report"), write the substance of the referenced items into \`--intent\` in the captain's terms, not only the pointer; that substance is the captain's ask by reference, while Firstmate's build instructions and your own decisions still stay out.
This replaces the no-mistakes skill's advice to enrich \`--intent\` with decisions and tradeoffs; that advice does not apply to Firstmate-dispatched work.
Do not hand-edit, commit, or fix findings yourself while a run is active - the pipeline applies every fix.

One drive call blocks until the next gate or outcome, which routinely outlives what your harness lets a single command run: Claude Code kills a command at ten minutes maximum, while one fix round is capped around thirty minutes and up to three rounds chain.
So background the drive call instead of sitting in one blocking hold your harness will kill, and read its return when it finishes.
Where a harness's own command limit is not established, assume it bounds commands and use that same backgrounded shape.
${pr_return_line}Whenever a drive call returns without a gate or an outcome - its own wait elapsed, or it was killed or timed out - reattach at once by re-running \`no-mistakes axi run\` without flags, backgrounded the same way${pr_reattach_clause} if it refuses because no run is active, read the finished outcome from \`no-mistakes axi status\`.
A killed or timed-out call is never evidence the daemon died: the daemon accepts your response immediately and runs the round in the background, so the call was only ever waiting for a read while the run kept working.
Reattach and keep going rather than reporting the pipeline blocked; rule 7 owns the checks that decide when a pipeline block is real.

Two firstmate-specific rules layer on top of that guidance:
- ask-user findings are never yours to answer: escalate to firstmate using rule 6's ask-user format and stop.
  Firstmate applies \`ask-user-authority\` and obtains any required captain decision.
  When the decision comes back, feed it to the gate with \`no-mistakes axi respond\` and let the pipeline apply it - do not route the question to "the user" or implement the fix yourself.
- NEVER pass \`--yes\` (or \`-y\`) to \`no-mistakes axi run\` or \`no-mistakes axi respond\`. It is banned fleet-wide.
  It auto-resolves every gate including ask-user findings with no escalation, and answering your own ask-user finding is a hard rule violation.

2. Run \`gerrit-axi publish --squash --json\`, adding \`--branch <b>\` only when the task names a target branch other than the server's default.
   It is one push to \`refs/for/<branch>\` that turns every commit since your branch left the server's branch into ONE change carrying the oldest commit's message, so that message is the review description: make it the one you want reviewed.
   It keeps any \`Change-Id\` a commit already carries and stamps one into the oldest commit when it has none, rewriting your local branch's messages only.
   Never edit, remove, or regenerate a \`Change-Id\`: a different one creates a different change and orphans the first one's review, while the same one adds a patch set to it.
   Never pass \`--stack\`: a stack of changes is not published from this fleet until it can be watched by its membership pinned when its watch is armed, and the watch follows exactly one change.
3. Read the record it prints: \`ok\` must be \`true\`, and the one row of its \`changes\` table is your change. Its \`url\` is the change URL; when \`url\` is null, write \`https://<host>/c/<project>/+/<change>\` from your \`origin\` remote's host and that row's \`project\` and \`change\`.
   A failure prints a typed error record instead; fix what it names and publish again, which updates the same change rather than creating another.
Then append \`done [at=<epoch>]: PR {change url} published for review\` to the status file and stop. You are finished.
That \`done:\` is accepted only when the change's current patch set on the server carries this copy's HEAD tree, so commit nothing after publishing; if you must change the work, commit it and publish again before reporting done.
A \`done:\` whose URL is not the canonical \`https://<host>/c/<project>/+/<number>\` change URL is refused.
There is no pull request, no \`gh-axi\` call, and no forge CI result to report: a human reviewer approves and submits the change on the server, and firstmate relays that outcome.

This project's review server is Gerrit: it has no pull requests and no forge CI the pipeline can watch, so **no-mistakes runs here as a review pass that ends at a ready branch**, and you then publish that branch as one change.
Pass \`--skip push,pr,ci\` on every \`no-mistakes axi run\` for this task, and skip nothing else: \`review\`, \`test\`, \`document\`, and \`lint\` are the whole point of the run.
Those three are the only steps that reach a forge, and skipping them is a supported outcome, not a degraded one.
The task is complete only when committed on your branch.
When you believe it is complete, append \`done [at=<epoch>]: {summary}\` to the status file and stop.
Firstmate will then instruct you to run /no-mistakes to validate.

Because \`push\` is skipped, the pipeline's fixes DO NOT arrive in your checkout: each fix round commits onto a branch inside no-mistakes' own local gate repository, and with no push nothing carries those commits back to you.
Your tree never goes dirty and nothing interrupts you, so a passed run whose fixes are still in the gate looks exactly like a passed run whose fixes you already have.
You may not publish until you have closed that gap:
1. After the run reaches its outcome, read \`branch_sync.next_action\` from \`no-mistakes axi status\`.
2. When its code is \`recover_custody\`, run the exact command that status prints - \`no-mistakes axi sync --recover\` - and confirm \`branch_sync.state\` comes back \`custody_returned\` on a clean tree. The printed command is authoritative if it differs. The \`run_pipeline\` next action status reports after recovery is not an instruction to run again: the recovered head is the one the passed run validated, so publish it.
3. Confirm with \`git log\` that \`$branch\` now carries every fix commit the run made, whether or not step 2 was needed.
An unrecovered fix round is an unfinished task, never housekeeping: publishing without it is how the UNFIXED code reaches review.
Your ready report is refused while the run still holds your branch, while its outcome is missing or not passing, or while your HEAD's tree differs from the run's result.

When the run's outcome is passed, passed-with-skips, or passed-with-override and step 3 holds, publish.
The squashed change carries only the oldest commit's message, so the pipeline's own fix commits never reach the reviewer's description; your report is how they reach the captain.
After publishing and immediately before your ready report, append one line \`note [at=<epoch>]: pipeline changes: {finding} - {fix it made}; {finding} - {fix it made}\` to the status file, one short clause per finding the run fixed, taken from the run's \`fixes\` table and the gate findings its drive calls returned (\`no-mistakes axi logs --step <step> --full\` has the detail); write \`note [at=<epoch>]: pipeline changes: none\` when it fixed nothing.

This task ships **direct-PR**: you raise the PR yourself, without the no-mistakes pipeline.
The task is complete only when committed on your branch.
When it is implemented and committed, push your branch and open a PR with \`gh-axi\` that is ready for review, not a draft.
Before you report done, read the PR back from the forge and confirm it is not a draft (\`gh pr view <url> --json isDraft\` must print false); if it is a draft, mark it ready with \`gh-axi pr ready\`.
A draft cannot be merged, so a done report on one leaves the merge unasked.
Then append \`done [at=<epoch>]: PR {url}\` to the status file and stop.
That \`done:\` is accepted only when this copy's HEAD - your latest commit - is pushed to your PR branch; the check tests that commit, not merely that a branch moved.
If you deliberately keep the PR a draft, append \`paused [at=<epoch>]: {why the draft is held}\` instead of done.
Do NOT run /no-mistakes. The configured merge authority decides whether to merge the PR; firstmate relays the outcome.

Delivery contract: mode=local-only
Ship branch: $branch
This task ships **local-only**: no remote, no PR, no pipeline.
The task is complete only when committed on your branch \`$branch\`. Do NOT push, do NOT open a PR, do NOT merge.
A \`done:\` is accepted when the named head is on this project's shared local branch, not only on a detached copy; the check tests that head, not merely that a branch moved.
Keep your branch a clean fast-forward onto the current default branch - if \`main\` has advanced, rebase onto it so the eventual merge stays a fast-forward.
When it is implemented and committed, append \`done [at=<epoch>]: ready in branch $branch\` to the status file and stop.
The configured merge authority approves the ready branch, then firstmate merges it into local \`main\` through the guarded fast-forward path.

Ship branch: $branch
The task is complete only when committed on your branch.
When you believe it is complete, append \`done [at=<epoch>]: {summary}\` to the status file and stop.
Firstmate will then instruct you to run /no-mistakes to validate and ship a PR.
That first \`done:\` is the handoff that starts the pipeline, which owns the push; it is not a request to push from this copy.

After /no-mistakes reports CI green (the CI-ready return point - do not wait for it to keep monitoring in the background until merge), read the PR back from the forge and confirm it is not a draft (\`gh pr view <url> --json isDraft\` must print false); if it is a draft, mark it ready with \`gh-axi pr ready\`.
A draft cannot be merged, so a done report on one leaves the merge unasked.
Then append \`done [at=<epoch>]: PR {url} checks green\` and stop. You are finished.
That CI-ready \`done:\` is accepted only when this copy's HEAD - your latest commit - is one the /no-mistakes run pushed, so commit nothing after the run; the check tests that commit, not merely that a branch moved.
If you deliberately keep the PR a draft, append \`paused [at=<epoch>]: {why the draft is held}\` instead of done.
