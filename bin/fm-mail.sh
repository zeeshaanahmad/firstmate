# fm-mail.sh - general-purpose mail plane for reading and sending mail.
#
# Reads inbound mail over IMAP and sends mail over SMTP on demand. This is an
# ordinary mail client surface, not an escalation of authority: every surfaced
# message is a notification firstmate reads before deciding, and firstmate still
# applies its own judgment exactly as it would for a TUI message (including
# return/away and other rules).
#
# Subcommands:
#   read                 List unseen INBOX mail as a compact digest (From /
#                        Date / Subject / first line).
#   send <to> <subject> <body | ->
#                        Send one message. A "-" body reads plain text from
#                        stdin.
#   poll                 Surface UNSEEN mail this home has not yet woken as a
#                        `check` wake so firstmate answers it concisely. IMAP
#                        \Seen mail never wakes a poll, no message is ever
#                        marked read (BODY.PEEK), and every surfaced message
#                        is keyed by its immutable IMAP UID so expunge
#                        renumbering never re-wakes or loses mail. A uid whose
#                        header could not be fetched is woken once degraded
#                        and later re-woken once with recovered metadata. The
#                        cursor also records the mailbox generation
#                        (UIDVALIDITY) so a recreated mailbox cannot reuse a
#                        numeric uid and suppress a new wake, and overlapping
#                        polls are serialized on the mail-seen lock. poll
#                        itself has no scheduler: run it manually, from
#                        `at`/cron, or via the standing check armed by
#                        bin/fm-mail-check.sh (docs/configuration.md
#                        "Mail plane").
#   status               Print configuration and the last poll cursor. No
#                        network, no wake.
#
# Volume: poll surfaces at most FM_MAIL_POLL_MAX_WAKES messages per run
# (default 20, valid 1..200); a larger flood is left unseen so the next poll
# surfaces the next batch, keeping the durable wake queue bounded no matter how
# much inbound mail arrives. A header fetch that fails is still surfaced once
# (degraded placeholders) and retried on later polls until the real metadata
# lands; a persistently unfetchable uid is never skipped and never re-wakes.
#
# Deployment - credentials and endpoints are read from the environment,
# filling missing keys from the gitignored $FM_HOME/.env (same convention
# as the Relay/FMX token; env wins). Add these four required values, plus
# the optional ports and timeout:
#   FM_MAIL_USER=<imap/smtp account>
#   FM_MAIL_PASS=<password>
#   FM_IMAP_HOST=<imap host>
#   FM_IMAP_PORT=<imap port>     (default 993, implicit TLS)
#   FM_SMTP_HOST=<smtp host>
#   FM_SMTP_PORT=<smtp port>     (default 465, implicit TLS)
#   FM_MAIL_TIMEOUT=<seconds>    (default 20; IMAP/SMTP socket timeout)
# FM_HOME falls back to the repo root when unset. This script carries no secret
# and no default endpoint that could resolve against a wrong home; FM_MAIL_USER,
# FM_MAIL_PASS, FM_IMAP_HOST, and FM_SMTP_HOST are always required, and
# FM_MAIL_PASS is never logged. The wake library is sourced from next to this
# script, not from $FM_HOME/bin; cursor, journal, retry set, and queue stay
# under $FM_HOME/state.
#
# IMAP/SMTP work is delegated to bin/fm-mail.py (imaplib/smtplib, implicit TLS
# on 993/465). STARTTLS and port 587 are not supported. BODY.PEEK is used on
# read/poll so mail is never marked seen before firstmate actually answers it.
