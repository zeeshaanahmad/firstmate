# that - it decides whether to start, attach to, or replace a real watcher
# process, so a leftover beacon must never satisfy it. bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh
# also keeps this strict check because it fires at the turn boundary where the
# auto-arm brings a fresh watcher up. The pull warning (bin/fm-guard.sh) fires
# mid-turn, where the auto-arm model runs no watcher at all, so it wants a
# different, model-aware question:

# fm_supervision_model
# Print the supervision model of this home's PRIMARY harness:
#   autoarm     Claude's Stop-hook auto-arm and Cursor's stop-hook park: the
#               watcher is armed at each turn end and exits on its wake, so it
#               runs only BETWEEN turns. Mid-turn a fresh beacon with no live
#               watcher process is healthy, and a stale beacon is still healthy
#               while a Claude auto-arm generation explains the gap
#               (fm_autoarm_midturn_healthy).
#   extension   Pi (and pi-signed): .pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts owns
#               continuity. It tears the watcher down on every actionable wake and
#               spawns the replacement itself, so a genuinely unheld singleton lock
#               is healthy during that hand-off only with extension ownership and a
#               fresh beacon. Any held but unhealthy lock remains down.
#   persistent  every other harness (codex foreground checkpoint, opencode/grok
#               background arm, tmux, unknown): the watcher runs as a tracked live
#               process, so a live identity-matched pid is the real liveness signal.

# Slot-owner claim: which task a Treehouse pool slot currently belongs to.
#
# Treehouse can record ownership durably: `treehouse get --lease --lease-holder`
# reserves a slot under a label until `treehouse return --if-lease-holder`
# releases it, and Firstmate uses exactly that for secondmate homes
# (bin/fm-home-seed.sh). Crewmate spawns do not take that path: they acquire
# their slot through the interactive pane-driven `treehouse get`, whose state
# entry is a live process lease (owner_pid plus owner_started_at, and `treehouse
# status` reports in-use from the processes actually running under the path).
# That answers "is anything running here", never "which task owns this", and it
# is released by the very event that makes a task record stale - the worker
# exiting - so a slot whose lease has lapsed reads identical whether it is still
# this task's or has since been handed to another one. Firstmate therefore keeps
# its own claim on top: one file naming the task that took the slot, written by
# bin/fm-spawn.sh under the same project lock that allocates the slot and
# released by bin/fm-teardown.sh when the slot goes back to the pool. Moving
# crewmate spawns onto the durable lease is separate follow-up work.
#
# The claim lives at <pool>/<slot>/.fm-slot-owner - a sibling of the repo
# checkout rather than a file inside it - so claiming a slot can never dirty the
# copy teardown's landed-work checks inspect, and a returned slot carries no

# --- Claude Stop auto-arm generation claims -----------------------------------
# Both Stop-event participants (bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh and
# bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh --claude) coordinate through the epoch ledger
# state/.claude-autoarm-epoch, whose monotonic epoch sequence IS the claim
# generation. This is an optimistic, generation-based single-flight design:
#
#   - The CURRENT claim is the ledger's latest entry: line 1 begins with the
#     "epoch=N owner_pid=P outcome=O updated_at=T" record. A "rewake" outcome
#     also records "session_pid=S recovery_generation=G", binding that
#     handling turn to its live session-lock owner and watcher recovery episode.
#     Line 2 is the claiming process's pid-identity, the same identity every other
#     supervision lock in this repo records (fm_pid_identity above). The
#     identity is MANDATORY: a claimant that cannot record it does not claim
#     (continuity falls to the synchronous guard), and the identity is read
#     from the ledger entry alone - never substituted from any lock - so a
#     reused pid can never authenticate someone else's stale entry.
#   - A claim is OPEN (fm_autoarm_claim_open) while its outcome is "arming",
#     its owner pid is alive, its recorded identity successfully recomputes
#     and matches that pid, and it is not STUCK - stuck meaning both the
#     ledger entry and the watcher beacon (state/.last-watcher-beat) are older
#     than the guard grace, which proves the owner hung mid-arm with nothing
#     supervising (every legitimate arming phase with no watcher is bounded in
#     seconds, while a healthy hours-long cycle keeps the beacon beating).
#   - Every firing DEFERS (exits 0) to an open claim; anything else - a
#     terminal outcome, a dead or identity-mismatched owner, a stuck owner, an
#     identityless entry, or no claim at all - lets the next firing take
#     generation N+1 (fm_autoarm_claim_next). Taking a newer generation IS the
#     reclaim: a steady-state predecessor is never signalled or revoked.
#   - NO mutex is ever held across a blocking step. The owner lock
#     state/.claude-autoarm.lock survives only as a micro-mutex serializing
#     individual ledger reads-then-writes (a few non-blocking file
#     operations); a holder that dies inside the hold is reclaimed by
#     fm_lock_try_acquire's ordinary dead-owner steal.
#   - A superseded owner goes COMPLETELY silent - cleanup only. Ownership is
#     re-verified before every side effect: each arm invocation, each
#     episode-state mutation, each ledger write, and each continuation.
#   - The irrevocable commit point of a translation is the EXIT STATUS: the
#     harness delivers the collected stderr banner only on exit 2 and discards
#     it on exit 0. Markerless outcomes commit with the owned terminal ledger
#     write. The once-per-episode failure notice commits only when its marker is
#     created after the winning "failed" write in the same owned critical
#     section. A superseded generation or failed required-marker creation is
#     refused and exits 0 silently even after printing; a later generation
#     supersedes the terminal entry and retries the notice.
#
# This structurally removes the failure classes the lock-held-across-arm
# design produced: a hung owner deferring every later firing forever (observed
# 2026-08-26: a hook hung mid-arm with its ledger frozen at "arming" kept the
# watcher from ever being auto-re-armed again; and 2026-08-14: a finished
# claim whose leftover lock silenced both participants for 40 beacon-less
# minutes), a reclaim mutex held across a blocking banner write recreating the
# same unreclaimable-live-owner shape, and a reclaimed-but-alive owner racing
# its replacement to translate one close twice.
#
# Two bounded residuals are ACCEPTED INTENT, because closing them absolutely
# would require a mutex held across output or steady-state revocation, both
# deliberately rejected: (1) an owner that dies between its owned terminal
# write and its own process exit leaves a committed outcome whose banner was
# never delivered (process-death territory; the durable wake queue retains the
# underlying event), and (2) a hung old-build owner that resumes during the
# one legacy upgrade window may add one duplicate continuation. Each residual
# costs at most one extra exit-2 continuation turn absorbed by the durable
# idempotent wake queue. A claim misread as stuck in a pathological race
# (e.g. a beacon read right at system wake) likewise yields at most one extra
# arm that the watcher singleton dedupes, while the superseded owner still
# goes silent.
#
# fm_autoarm_claim_abandoned / fm_autoarm_release_abandoned below survive as
# the LEGACY shim for a lock-holding claim from a pre-generation build (the
# lock carries a role file only in that legacy shape, and in the guard's own
# short terminal-check hold): a live legacy owner still defers per the legacy
# proof, and a proven-abandoned one is reclaimed once through the steal mutex
# - with an identity-verified live owner retired via TERM first, because old
# code cannot re-check generations - so an upgrade mid-session can neither
# double-arm nor deadlock behind a hung legacy hook.

# serialization fm_lock_try_acquire uses for stale-owner reclaim: while it is
# held no other process can publish the primary lock, so the window between
# proving abandonment and removing the lock cannot swallow a genuine new
# claim.
#
# Old-build code cannot re-check generations, so a LIVE proven-abandoned
# legacy owner whose recorded identity is verified to match its pid is retired
# with TERM before the lock is removed: once the TERM is successfully queued
# the process can never resume normal execution (delivery precedes any further
# user code when it continues), so a short bounded wait for observed exit is a
# courtesy, not a requirement. A pid is never signalled without a verified
# matching identity; when the kill itself fails or the identity stops matching
# mid-procedure (pid reuse), the reclaim refuses. Missing identity evidence
# never blocks the reclaim of a proven-abandoned claim - it only disables the

# state/.seen-* marker.
# fm-classify-lib.sh's header owns the status marker contract, including its
# independent reported signature and classified position.

# Guarded self-announced status append - the one dedup primitive for the status
# lines THIS home's own machinery writes as bookkeeping it has already presented
# in the very turn or tick that writes them (answerer-closes resolved lines, a
# pending-reply escalation close, captain-held transfers). Such a close must
# not wake the session that wrote it, so this appends one command's lines
# together, records the exact appended byte range in the home-owned append
# ledger (bin/fm-classify-lib.sh), and then advances the watcher's seen marker
# across the appended bytes and no byte this home has not already read. The
# advance is provenance-gated and fails toward waking:
#   - the marker advances only when this home already read every pre-append
#     byte, the post-append size equals that size plus exactly the appended
#     bytes (no foreign write interleaved), AND the watcher's own span
#     classifier finds no actionable event from its classified offset through
#     the post-append end (classifying after the append keeps the just-closed
#     decisions from counting as live);
#   - "already read" means the watcher's classified seen offset equals the
#     pre-append size, or the OPEN DECISIONS fold cursor does and every
#     non-blank line the watcher has not classified yet is a keyed
#     needs-decision or blocked line, which OPEN DECISIONS listed as open. The
#     fold reads bytes it never prints, so a worker's `failed:`, `paused:`,
#     `working:`, `resolved` or verb-less line there must still wake, and so
#     must a captain-held line, which raises the watcher's needs-decision
#     side-band;
#   - on ANY other condition - a missing file, pending foreign bytes, an
#     interleaved writer, an unreadable size or identity - the lines are still
#     appended and the owned range is still recorded when growth is proven, but
#     the marker is left alone, so the watcher surfaces the file normally.
# Later signal scans treat owned ranges as already owned even when the watcher
# has not caught up, so separate --resolve-key answers do not each force a
# captain-facing wake. A later, different line from any other writer grows the
# size past the owned ranges and wakes as before: task identity alone can never
# suppress new content.
# Each line is stamped with its emission time on the way in (status_stamp_line,
# bin/fm-classify-lib.sh), so the appended bytes are the stamped ones, not the
# caller's: a caller that caps a line first must reserve status_stamp_width,
# and one that suppresses a repeat must ask status_event_recorded rather than
# compare exact bytes.
# Returns 0 appended and self-announced, 1 appended but left for the watcher
# (the safe direction), 2 the append itself failed.
