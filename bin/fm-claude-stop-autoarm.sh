# Claude Stop-owned watcher auto-arm (asyncRewake hook).
#
# Registered in tracked .claude/settings.json as a Stop command hook with
# "asyncRewake": true and an explicit multi-hour timeout. Claude Code fires it
# in the background on EVERY Stop of a Claude primary session, with no
# deduplication across firings. It owns routine tokenless watcher continuity
# for Claude primaries (main home and marked secondmate homes):
#
#   - Scope: only a genuine primary checkout (plain checkout or validly marked
#     secondmate home) with AGENTS.md, bin/, and the effective state dir - the
#     exact fm-turnend-guard.sh scope. Child crew/scout worktrees stay inert.
#   - Identity: only when THIS session holds state/.lock, as
#     bin/fm-session-lock-lib.sh decides it: the recorded pid is a harness
#     ancestor, or a live lock was recorded under this same trusted Claude
#     session id (which is what keeps a background session arming after its
#     transient helper chain is recycled).
#     When an existing numeric owner fails the shared harness-liveness predicate,
#     the hook delegates guarded recovery to bin/fm-lock.sh and then re-verifies
#     ownership. A live owner, missing lock, malformed lock, or unresolved
#     ancestry remains inert, so a competing session never arms or rewakes.
#   - AFK: while state/.afk exists the away daemon owns the watcher and triage;
#     this hook exits 0 and NEVER rewakes the primary (checked again at
#     translation time so a mid-cycle AFK transition is honored).
#   - Need: arms only while the home needs supervision, as
#     bin/fm-supervision-lib.sh defines it; an idle home exits 0.
#   - Single-flight: Claude does not dedupe async hooks, so exactly one
#     GENERATION owner arms per event epoch: the epoch ledger's monotonic
#     sequence is the claim generation, every firing defers (exit 0) to a live
#     open claim, and a stuck, dead, identity-mismatched, or finished claim is
#     superseded by taking the next generation instead of being unlocked or
#     revoked. No mutex is ever held across arming or output - the owner lock
#     survives only as the micro-mutex serializing individual ledger writes -
#     and a superseded owner goes completely silent: ownership is re-verified
#     before every arm invocation, episode-state mutation, ledger write, and
#     continuation (fm_autoarm_claim_open/fm_autoarm_claim_next in
#     bin/fm-wake-lib.sh own the contract, including the legacy shim for a
#     pre-generation lock).
#   - Foreground arm: the owner runs bin/fm-watch-arm.sh as a tracked child it
#     waits on inside this hook-owned process tree (never a fire-and-forget
#     shell &); Claude owns the process group, so its timeout/session teardown
#     kills arm and watcher together, and the hook TERMs the arm with itself.
#     HUP, TERM, and INT are translated through the ordinary durable failure
#     handoff instead of leaving the generation frozen at arming. Claude does
#     not deliver the exit 2 of a hook it terminated at the configured timeout
#     as a rewake (measured on Claude Code 2.1.278 and 2.1.281,
#     docs/verification/supervision.md), so a park that outlives that timeout
#     records the failure durably without waking an idle primary; nothing here
#     shortens a quiet park, because no-change heartbeats are absorbed without
#     closing the arm.
#   - Handling successor: Pi, omp, and OpenCode start the next arm before they
#     deliver an actionable wake, so the fleet stays covered while the model
#     handles it. After an actionable close, including an attached peer cycle
#     that ended, this hook starts one successor bin/fm-watch-arm.sh with the
#     closed arm's pid as FM_WATCH_PREDECESSOR_ARM_PID, the same handoff the
#     Pi extension passes for its closed arm child, so the arm starts a
#     handling-successor watcher and links the lifecycle ledger. A child of
#     this hook cannot outlive the exit-2 rewake, so the successor is launched
#     the one way a process survives a Claude hook: nohup, stdio detached, in
#     its own process group (the shape bin/fm-startup-network.sh uses;
#     docs/verification/supervision.md records the survival check). The hook
#     waits for the successor's one status line, adds one banner line when no
#     live watcher was confirmed, and never withholds the wake for it; the
#     next Stop's foreground arm attaches to that live cycle. The supervision
#     host owns its own successors, so its path is unchanged.
#   - Supervision host: a home opted in with config/supervision-host
#     (docs/configuration.md "Supervision host" owns the opt-in) runs
#     bin/fm-supervision-host.sh in the arm's place, bound to this generation.
#     To this hook it is an arm that also takes away-posture wakes itself and
#     ends its own park before the hook timeout with a "supervision-host:"
#     line, which is actionable here like a wake line; its rewake banner
#     carries every "supervision-host:" line the host printed, in order, while
#     its wake lines keep the arm's eight-line cap. A "supervision-host stood
#     down:" close exits 0 silently, and a host that died without a close is
#     retried instead of being judged by the healthy-watcher predicate
#     (docs/supervision-host.md). Without the file nothing below changes.
#   - Translation: while supervision is still needed and AFK remains inactive,
#     an actionable arm close (signal:/stale:/check:/heartbeat) prints one
#     rewake banner to stderr and exits 2, which wakes Claude even while idle
#     ("Stop hook feedback"). The irrevocable commit point is the EXIT STATUS:
#     the harness delivers the collected stderr only on exit 2, so an owned
#     terminal commit decides the exit. Markerless outcomes commit with the
#     ledger write; the failure notice additionally requires its marker write.
#     A refused generation exits 0 silently even after printing. A close that
#     reports no actionable reason is benign when a live identity-matched
#     watcher still has a fresh beacon.
#   - Failure handling: a typed failure is rechecked against the same live,
#     fresh watcher predicate and retried a bounded number of times in this
#     hook. Only an exhausted failure with no verified watcher emits one
#     last-resort notice per failure episode; later consecutive failures still
#     exit 2 to guarantee the next Stop-owned retry without repeating notice,
#     until the synchronous guard has consumed its attended fail-open.
#
# The epoch ledger state/.claude-autoarm-epoch records the latest claim
# generation and outcome, and binds rewake outcomes to the session-lock pid and
# watcher recovery generation, so the synchronous Stop guard
# (bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh --claude) can allow a stop whose recovery this hook
# already owns, instead of forcing a duplicate continuation for the same event
# epoch. The failure marker
# state/.claude-autoarm-failure-notified deduplicates the last-resort notice,
# and state/.claude-autoarm-failure-alarmed bounds the attended fail-open and
# suppresses any later automatic continuation in that unresolved episode.
#
# This hook never blocks the Stop decision itself and never prints to stdout:
# exit 0 is always silent, and exit 2 carries the rewake banner on stderr.
# On any uncertainty such as unresolvable ancestry, malformed lock state, or
# lock contention, it exits 0 and leaves continuity to the synchronous guard and
# the model.
