# launchd exec target for the Firstmate-owned dev.firstmate.herdr.fm-remote
# launch agent: make the Aqua login session own the fm-remote Herdr server.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-remote-herdr-guard.sh <herdr-path> <session>
#
# bin/fm-remote-doctor.sh renders the launch agent as the account's login
# shell running `exec <this script> <herdr> fm-remote` with
# LimitLoadToSessionType=Aqua, RunAtLoad, KeepAlive={SuccessfulExit=false},
# and ThrottleInterval=10, then bootstraps it into gui/<uid>. That domain, not
# the login shell, is what gives this process and every server it execs the
# Aqua audit session and login-keychain access; the login shell only gives the
# server the account's own environment.
# `herdr server` stays in the foreground under launchd, as verified in
# docs/verification/runtime-backends.md under "fm-remote server birth and login-keychain access", so the final exec provides the complete supervision lifecycle.
#
# Decision, made once per launch (exit codes matter under SuccessfulExit=false:
# 0 tells launchd the job is done until something restarts it, non-zero asks
# for a retry after the throttle interval):
#   no server owns the session socket  -> exec `herdr server --session <s>`
#                                          (foreground, launchd-supervised)
#   the owner was born in the Aqua session (launchd or the Aqua remote-job
#   worker)                            -> exit 0, leave it alone
#   the owner was born anywhere else (an SSH remote attach, a shell over
#   ssh/mosh, or a birth it cannot prove) -> `herdr server stop`, wait until the
#                                          socket is released, then exec
#                                          `herdr server --session <s>` at once
#                                          so the socket is rebound before a
#                                          reconnecting SSH attach can start
#                                          another foreign server
#   the foreign server does not release the socket in time -> exit 1
# A takeover closes every pane in that session; the parent firstmate's
# secondmate liveness sweep relaunches its mates into the Aqua-born server.
# bin/fm-remote-herdr-owner-lib.sh owns the owner discovery and the birth
# markers; FM_REMOTE_HERDR_GUARD_STOP_WAIT_TENTHS (default 50) bounds the
# release wait in tenths of a second. Every decision prints one line to
# stdout, which launchd routes to the agent's log.
