#
# register   Record a built-in source: its adapter, its canonical id, and the
#            exact argv to execute. argv is stored one argument per line and
#            executed directly, so there is no shell surface and no argument
#            splitting. Built-in adapters register sources; nothing here parses
#            user text.
# register-task
#            Record a worker-owned built-in source. Its one source record
#            persists across rounds, and re-registration by the same task
#            acknowledges nonterminal captured rounds without touching the
#            source claim. Terminal rounds are concluded with `handled`.
# register-extension
#            Resolve an explicitly enabled home-local process-event-adapter/1
#            binding, verify its package and handshake, and record the source
#            configuration reference with the exact extension id/version,
#            capability version, package digest, binding digest, and a fresh
#            registration token. The tracked extension host constructs every
#            invocation; no package argv or shell command is stored.
# classify   Ask the immutable adapter owner captured beside <result-file> for a
#            bounded classification. Built-in results keep their existing
#            script command; extension results must still match the exact bound
#            package identity captured with them.
# ensure-listening
#            Confirm the current registration generation's listener is running.
#            Starts one when nothing live is in the way, and returns only after
#            that generation's live claim or its launch stamp says it started.
#            The wait is the reconcile confirm window and ends early on evidence.
#            No evidence within the window is a nonzero result. Exit 3 means a
#            live listener from another registration generation still held the
#            source when the window ended, so this generation cannot start until
#            it is retired.
# start      Claim the source, run its child to completion, durably capture the
#            output, publish normalized wakes for pending results, then release
#            the claim. It blocks for as long as the source blocks and is meant
#            to run as a supervised background process, never in a conversational
#            turn. After publishing, it asks the source's own adapter whether the
#            captured result ends the source and normally retires the registration
#            when it says so, so a source that has ended stops being restarted.
#            A task-owned source instead keeps its terminal round open and
#            registered until its owner concludes it with `handled`.
# reconcile  Idempotent liveness entry the watcher calls on its ordinary cycle:
#            republish every durably captured result with no handled
#            acknowledgement yet - regardless of any earlier publication - and
#            start a runner for any registered source that has no live owner and
#            no open task-owned round. This is liveness repair only - it never
#            discovers results by
#            polling the source, because the child blocks on the source itself.
#            A start is REPORTED only once it is confirmed: starting a runner is
#            detached and its errors reach no caller, so a source that cannot
#            start would otherwise be counted exactly like one that is
#            listening, and a wedged source would go on presenting as armed.
#            Every launch is counted as `started` only after the source is
#            observed owned or its launch-pacing stamp has moved, `failed`
#            otherwise, and any failure also makes this command exit non-zero.
#            One bounded window covers a whole cycle's launches
#            (FM_PROCEVENT_LAUNCH_CONFIRM_SECONDS; docs/configuration.md).
#            A launch that fails to confirm is also announced as a durable
#            `check` wake, once per failure episode - keyed by the registration
#            identity it ran under and ended by a later launch of that source
#            confirming - because the supervision cycle discards the `failed=`
#            count. The launch itself is retried every cycle exactly as before.
#            A source whose claim nothing may automatically displace is not
#            relaunched at all; it is counted `uncertain` and announced once per
#            stranded claim generation as a durable `check` wake, because the
#            supervision cycle discards this command's own output and exit
#            status. The wake names what clears that strand: the `start`
#            command for a reused pid whose group survives, or the check a
#            human makes for a group that lost its leader, which `start`
#            reports as owned and which the next cycle reclaims on its own
#            once that group is empty.
# handled    Durably and idempotently record that a captured result has been
#            fully handled: <source-id> <sequence>. Prints "handled: id seq"
#            the first time for that exact source-and-sequence generation and
#            "already-handled: id seq" on every repeat call, atomically
#            deduplicated so a paired external effect is never authorized
#            twice. Until this is called, the result stays eligible for
#            bounded re-announcement on every reconcile. Marking a result
#            handled does not retire its source registration or claim, with one
#            exception: acknowledging the terminal round of a task-owned source
#            is that board's conclude step, so it also drops the registration
#            that kept the board with its owner, and reports `retired:` too.
# retire     Drop a registration, stop a runner this home owns, release the claim.
#            Idempotent, and still the supported explicit path after a source has
#            already retired itself on its adapter's terminal verdict. Existing
#            unconditional built-in retirement remains compatible. An external
#            registration requires --if-owner. --if-matches compares a complete
#            built-in registration, --if-absent refuses while any registration
#            exists, and --if-owner removes only the exact extension registration
#            token printed by register-extension, so a stale owner cannot retire
#            a replacement generation.
# sweep-home Retire a bounded snapshot of this home's registrations and owned
#            claims, then refuse unless no registration, runner record, or owned
#            claim remains. Used by supported Firstmate home retirement.
# binding-retirement-preflight
#            Refuse while an extension registration or unhandled captured result
#            still owns the exact enabled binding digest. Called by the tracked
#            extension host before identity-conditional binding retirement.
# extension-retirement
#            Serialize one tracked binding or transfer retirement against
#            extension resolution and registration publication in this home.
# extension-bind
#            Serialize tracked binding publication against extension resolution,
#            registration publication, and retirement in this home.
# list       Show registered sources, owners, and pending captured results.
#
# Terminal knowledge is adapter-owned. This runner never inspects a result and
# never names an adapter-specific status: built-ins keep the existing
# `bin/fm-procevent-<adapter>.sh terminal <result-file>` path, while an external
# result uses the exact process-event-adapter/1 package identity captured beside
# it. Exit 0 is the only terminal verdict. A missing command, an error, or any
# other exit keeps the registration armed, so an adapter that has no notion of
# ending needs no change.
#
# Routine no-op knowledge is adapter-owned through the same kind of seam. Some
# sources produce a result that carries no news at all - a review surface that
# simply closed with nothing said - and announcing it makes the handler read a
# wake to learn that nothing happened. So before publishing, this runner asks
# the immutable captured adapter owner - the built-in `silent` command or the
# bound extension operation - and treats exit 0 as the only silence verdict: the
# result is recorded handled and never announced, so it neither wakes a handler
# now nor returns on a later reconcile. Task-owned terminal rounds bypass this
# generic silence path and go to their owner's steering inbox so the owner can
# conclude the board. A missing command, an error, or any other exit publishes
# the wake exactly as before, so an adapter with no notion of a
# no-op needs no change and an unknown or degraded result always reaches its
# handler. This runner still inspects nothing and still names no adapter-specific
# condition. For built-ins, silence remains independent of the keyed-answer feed
# below: suppressing an announcement never suppresses the captain's own answer.
#
# Applying a built-in result is adapter-owned through the same kind of seam. Some results
# carry no judgement at all - they must simply be applied idempotently to the
# home's own durable state - and leaving that to an agent that has to remember
# means it silently does not happen. So after publishing, `start` calls
# `bin/fm-procevent-<adapter>.sh autohandle <source-id> <sequence> <result-file>`
# and lets the adapter apply and acknowledge its own result. Exit 0 means the
# adapter fully handled it. A missing command, an error, or any other exit is not
# a failure of capture: the result stays unacknowledged and therefore eligible
# for re-announcement, so the handler still receives it exactly as before. This
# runner still inspects nothing and still names no adapter-specific condition.
# External bindings deliberately receive no autohandle operation.
#
# Built-in announcement is adapter-owned through one more seam of the same kind. An
# adapter that answers exit 0 to `bin/fm-procevent-<adapter>.sh self-announcing`
# declares that every result its autohandle fully applies is announced through a
# durable downstream channel of its own (for remote-reply, the mirrored parent
# status append the watcher's signal scan detects). For such an adapter, `start`
# runs autohandle FIRST and publishes a check wake only for what remains
# unhandled afterwards, so a fully autohandled capture never produces a second
# announcement and a byte-identical replay produces none at all. Every other
# adapter keeps the strict publish-before-apply order, because without a
# declared downstream channel an applied-and-acknowledged result would otherwise
# go silent. An unhandled result stays eligible for bounded re-announcement on
# every reconcile in both modes, exactly as before.
#
# Keyed captain answers from built-in adapters use one more seam of the same kind,
# and this runner still decides nothing about them. Some sources carry the
# captain's answer to a captain-held task. What such an answer MEANS is owned
# once, by bin/fm-captain-hold.sh's keyed-answer intake, and reaching it must not
# depend on an agent remembering. So after capture, a bound source
# has its result passed to
# `bin/fm-procevent-<adapter>.sh answers <result-file>`, and whatever that prints
# is piped straight into that one intake. The adapter reports only what the
# captain chose; the intake owns every rule about what happens next. This runner
# names no adapter, parses no result, and knows no decision rule, so a future
# built-in source needs nothing here beyond an `answers` command and a binding.
# Reconcile selections use the parallel `reconciles` adapter command and the
# binding-verified `reconcile-requests` intake, never the keyed-answer value.
# External binding responses never enter either authority-bearing intake.
#
# Feeding is deliberately independent of handling: it never acknowledges a result
# and never suppresses a wake. Recording the captain's answer is transcription,
# while ACTING on it is firstmate's judgement, so the capture stays unacknowledged
# and its `check` wake reaches the handler exactly as it would have anyway.
#
# A runner is bound to the HOME that owns it, not to the one session that armed
# it: a persistent source is meant to outlive that session, so reconcile stops a
# runner whose source is retired in a live home, and this lease is the backstop
# for a home that is GONE. Detaching a runner into its own
# process group is what lets a persistent source outlive the turn that armed it,
# and with nothing else it is also what lets a runner outlive its whole home:
# reparented to init, it keeps its blocking child - and everything that child
# spawns - running with nobody left to reap it. So every runner starts a small
# guard beside it, in its own separate process group, which re-reads the owning
# state root's lease on a bounded cadence and stops the runner's whole process
# group once that lease can no longer be proved fresh. Owner-presence operations
# refresh the lease, an attached public start keeps it fresh while its caller
# remains attached, and the watcher's reconcile cycle keeps it fresh in a live
# home. A runner exports the inherited FM_PROCEVENT_IN_RUNNER marker and every
# refresh is skipped under it, so a runner and its ordinary children do not
# certify their own owner. That rule is CONFUSED-AGENT-GRADE, the grade
# bin/fm-lease-lib.sh documents: a source that DELIBERATELY strips the marker
# can still refresh, and adversarial-grade unforgeability is out of scope (see
# docs/configuration.md). Scope is the owning state root and one runner
# generation, never a script or process name, so a live source in
# another home is untouched. See bin/fm-procevent-lib.sh for the lease itself.
#
# Ownership is machine-wide per canonical source, because separate Firstmate
# homes can share one underlying source store. A live owner is never displaced;
# only a claim whose stale owner and independently absent process group prove
# its whole generation gone is reclaimed. A crashed leader or reused pid whose
# process group still has members cannot relax ownership cleanup. Reconcile
# signals only a live identity-matched runner group and otherwise keeps the
# claim without starting a replacement.
#
# Durability boundary: see bin/fm-procevent-lib.sh. This runner proves capture
# before publication and bounded re-announcement until handled, and nothing
# about the source side of the handoff.
