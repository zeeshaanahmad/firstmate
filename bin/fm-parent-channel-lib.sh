# fm-parent-channel-lib.sh - the one owner of a secondmate home's parent channel.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. A secondmate is a firstmate in its own home, and nobody reads
# its chat: the captain and the main firstmate see only what is appended to the
# parent channel. AGENTS.md tells every firstmate to reach the captain and to
# address the captain in every response, so a mate model reliably "reports" a
# PR-ready result, a finding, a decision, a blocker, or a failure in its own
# chat and skips the one status-file append that would actually deliver it.
# Four such misses were observed on 2026-09-02 across two mate homes; the
# watcher had delivered the parent's request each time and the work was done.
# The problem is therefore not one missed PR notice but every captain-facing
# outcome that depends on the model remembering to write to the channel.
# The fix is structural: every script that RECORDS a captain-facing outcome in a
# mate home publishes it on the parent channel itself, so delivery never
# depends on the model. This library owns where that channel lives and how a
# line is appended to it. The publishers are:
#   - bin/fm-inactive-reconcile.sh   a direct child's terminal done or failed
#                                    ledger line, on every watcher poll, plus
#                                    the silent-ledger inactive-outcome fallback
#   - bin/fm-pr-check.sh             a registered PR-ready line carrying the
#                                    canonical URL
#   - bin/fm-captain-hold.sh         a task held for the captain and its answer
#   - bin/fm-merge-outcome-lib.sh    a merged PR
#   - bin/fm-teardown.sh             the child's final ledger line, refusing to
#                                    remove the child while it is undelivered
#   - bin/fm-secondmate-report.sh     a marked request's correlated answer,
#                                    with this resolver choosing its destination
# The mate's own appends are reserved for judgement (bin/fm-brief.sh charter).
# docs/secondmate-parent-channel.md records the design and its coverage.
#
# THE CHANNEL. It is resolved from the home's own durable identity and parent
# binding, never from a caller's choice:
#   - the .fm-secondmate-home marker names the mate's id in its parent home;
#   - the .fm-secondmate-parent record (bin/fm-secondmate-parent-lib.sh) names
#     the route: a local route reports into the parent home's
#     state/<mate-id>.status, a remote route into this home's own
#     state/parent-replies.status, which the parent's remote reply adapter
#     mirrors line for line into that same parent file
#     (docs/remote-secondmates.md).
# The parent watcher classifies lines there exactly as it classifies any
# crewmate's status stream, so a captain-relevant line becomes a parent wake.
#
# Lines follow the charter's "<state> [key=<slug>]: <note>" shape and are
# appended at most once by exact content, so a retried publication cannot
# duplicate a delivered event. An existing destination must be a regular,
# non-symlinked file; a missing one is created with its directory.
#
# Return codes, shared by every entry point that resolves the channel:
#   0  resolved, or appended / already present
#   1  this is a main home (no .fm-secondmate-home marker): nothing to report
#   2  the identity marker exists but is unusable (symlink, NUL, bad id)
#   3  the parent binding is missing or unreadable
#   4  the append itself failed
# A caller that has already recorded the outcome locally must surface a
# non-zero return rather than treat it as delivered.
#
# Sourced by the publishers above and by tests. No side effects on source.
