#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-branch-report.sh - the supervision branch's report surface off Pi: the
# command twin of the Pi branch extension's fm_branch_report tool, for a
# branch session run by the supervision host (docs/supervision-host.md).
#
# It records exactly one handled fleet event in the durable outcome store
# (bin/fm-branch-outcome.sh owns the store) and gives the host the receipt it
# requires before it counts a wake handled. It enforces the same scoping the
# Pi tool does (docs/pi-supervision-branch.md "Components and their owners"):
# while the host's current turn claims signal or stale rows, only the tasks
# those rows resolve to may be reported - `fleet` and any remembered task are
# refused before the store is touched - and a claim that names no task (a
# heartbeat review, or a claimed heartbeat or check row) is unscoped. The
# claimed task set comes from .pi/extensions/lib/fm-branch-dispatch.ts through
# the host's turn record; this script only compares against it.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-branch-report.sh --task <id|fleet> --verdict routine|captain \
#       --summary <text> [--silent true|false] [--wake <text>]
#
# The verdict criteria are owned by bin/fm-branch-prompt.sh ("Verdict: routine
# or captain"); --silent true is legal only for a routine fleet outcome.
# --wake defaults to the wake reason the host recorded for the turn.
#
# Only the branch actor of a live host turn may report: FM_SUPERVISION_ACTOR
# must be "branch" and FM_BRANCH_REPORT_TURN must name the host's current turn
# record ($STATE/.supervision-host-turn), so a report typed after its turn
# ended, or from any other shell, is refused. Exit codes: 0 recorded, 1 the
# store refused or failed (nothing recorded), 2 usage, 3 refused (actor, turn,
# or scope).
#
# A row recorded after the captain returned (the away-posture record is gone)
# may be missing from the return brief, so it is also queued for MAIN as a
# durable check wake keyed supervision-host-return:<seq>, presented by the
# drain until MAIN acknowledges it. bin/fm-afk-return.sh archives the record
# before it reads the store and this check follows the append, so every row is
# in the brief, queued, or both: the relay does not depend on the host
# surviving its turn or on its owner delivering the host's own handback.
