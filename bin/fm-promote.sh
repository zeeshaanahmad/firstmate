# Promote a scout task to a ship task in place: the crewmate keeps its window,
# worktree, and loaded context; only the contract changes. Flips kind= to ship in
# state/<task-id>.meta so fm-teardown.sh applies the full ship-task teardown protection
# again. Promotion also writes the crewmate's ship instructions to
# data/<task-id>/ship-instructions.md, appends that same superseding contract to
# data/<task-id>/brief.md for future relaunches, and prints the fm-send.sh command
# that delivers it to the current worker. Those instructions carry the
# scratch-state inventory, the clean
# default-branch base, the immutable ship branch, and - rendered from
# bin/fm-dod-lib.sh, the single owner an ordinary ship brief also uses - the
# mode-specific Definition of done, so a promoted worker receives exactly the same
# delivery contract as a briefed one, including the no-mistakes mode's ask-user
# escalation rule and --yes ban. The instructions also carry `# Task` with
# `## Captain's intent` preserved from the scout brief and promotion's ship-time
# instructions under `## Firstmate spec`; the scout-time spec remains context but
# is not relabeled as the ship spec. Promotion refuses leftover `{TASK}` /
# `{FIRSTMATE_SPEC}` placeholders and a `## Captain's intent` line opening with
# a Captain label or address (bin/fm-dod-lib.sh). A pre-subsection scout
# brief contributes only Task lines explicitly marked as captain words to intent,
# read outside fenced blocks and indented examples so a quoted `Captain:` sample
# never passes the provenance gate as the ask (bin/fm-dod-lib.sh).
# A scout records no delivery posture, so promotion is where this task's delivery
# contract is decided: --mode, --yolo, and the ship branch resolved from
# --branch-prefix are written into the meta alongside the kind= flip. Firstmate resolves all three at promotion time, having just
# read the scout's report (AGENTS.md section 7); data/projects.md holds the
# captain's standing posture as context, and this script never looks that posture
# up. The registry IS read for one thing only: the project's forge binding, which
# is a project fact rather than a per-task decision, so promotion takes it from
# there instead of asking firstmate to remember it.
# no-mistakes-prod-only is a registry policy rather than a task mode and is refused.
# There is no --forge flag here: the binding comes from the registry, and for a
# task record naming no project it is none. bin/fm-brief.sh takes --forge instead
# because that script has no registry access at all, and bin/fm-spawn.sh checks
# its value against the registry; bin/fm-project-mode.sh's header owns the
# binding and bin/fm-dod-lib.sh owns what it changes for the worker, including
# the refusal of a forge on local-only.
# Usage: fm-promote.sh <task-id> --mode <no-mistakes|direct-PR|local-only> --yolo <on|off> [--branch-prefix <prefix>]

If these promotion steps were already completed before a relaunch, preserve the existing \`$BRANCH_Q\` branch and continue from its current state; do not repeat them destructively.
1. **Verify isolation before anything else.** Run \`pwd -P\` and \`git rev-parse --show-toplevel\`; both must resolve to the disposable task worktree you were launched in, such as a treehouse pool path or an Orca-managed worktree, not the primary checkout firstmate operates from. If either does not resolve to the worktree you were launched in, stop and escalate to firstmate.
2. Inventory this worktree's scratch state with \`git status\` and \`git log\` before changing anything.
3. Return to a clean default-branch base, then create your branch: \`git checkout -b $BRANCH_Q --\`.
4. Carry over only the intended fix changes. Leave scratch commits, debug edits, and experiment files behind.
5. If you reproduced a bug, turn that reproduction into a regression test.
6. Treat the scout-time Firstmate spec and any unmarked legacy \`# Task\` text as investigation context, not captain intent or current ship-time instructions.
7. Everything else in your original instructions carries over unchanged: the status protocol; the instruction inbox and its acknowledgement; the escalation rules, including ask-user; and every safety rule, except where the current delivery contract below explicitly replaces scout-only delivery rules.
