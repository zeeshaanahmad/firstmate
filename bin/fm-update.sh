# Self-update a running firstmate and its secondmates to the latest origin.
#
# Mechanical half of the /updatefirstmate skill. Fast-forwards the running
# firstmate repo's default branch from origin, then fast-forwards every
# registered secondmate home. Local homes are treehouse worktrees or standalone
# clones; remote routes update their configured code root on that host and then
# fast-forward the persistent home to that root. FAST-FORWARD ONLY, exactly like
# fm-fleet-sync.sh: never force, never create a merge commit, never stash;
# advance a target only when it is a clean fast-forward, otherwise skip and
# report. A tracked-files fast-forward never touches the gitignored operational
# dirs (data/, state/, config/, projects/, .no-mistakes/), so a secondmate's
# in-flight work is never disrupted. Worktrees of this repo share one object
# store, so a single fetch refreshes them all; standalone-clone homes are
# fetched on their own. Secondmate homes are leased at a detached HEAD on the
# default branch, so a fast-forward there advances HEAD only and never touches
# any other worktree's checkout or the shared `main` branch.
#
# The fast-forward mechanics live in bin/fm-ff-lib.sh (base_mode "origin" here);
# the same library drives local and remote parent-targeted secondmate sync, so
# there is one ff implementation, not several.
#
# It does NOT re-read AGENTS.md or nudge secondmates itself - those are LLM /
# tmux actions the skill performs. The script's job is the safe git mechanics
# plus a parseable summary telling the caller what to do next:
#   - one status line per target (updated/already current/skipped)
#   - reread-firstmate: yes|no    (did the running firstmate's instructions change)
#   - restart-secondmates: fm-<id>...|none (every live secondmate this pass left
#     on origin's tip - advanced OR already there - whose recorded runtime can
#     prove a restart)
#   - nudge-secondmates: fm-<id>...|none   (the residual: live secondmates on
#     that same tip whose runtime CANNOT prove a restart, so the older re-read
#     steer is all that is honest for them)
#
# The two sets are disjoint, and restart is UNCONDITIONAL on a successful update
# of that home. It is deliberately not gated on the git diff: replacing the agent
# is the only thing that re-resolves the launch-time wiring - turn-end hooks,
# harness flags, per-harness feature switches - which a running agent froze when
# it started and which no changed_instr list describes. An unchanged tracked
# surface therefore is NOT evidence that the running agent is already on the
# current behavior, so an ALREADY-CURRENT home restarts too.
#
# Only two things keep a live mate out of the restart set, and neither is papered
# over as a reload:
#   - its home was SKIPPED (dirty, diverged, offline, unsafe). It is not on the
#     new bytes, nothing here forces, stashes, or discards it, and it gets no
#     action at all.
#   - its runtime cannot prove the old agent stopped and a replacement came up
#     (bin/fm-secondmate-restart-lib.sh owns that test), so it falls to the
#     honest re-read steer and is reported as a nudge, never as a reload.
# A positively dead or missing endpoint has no agent to replace and is left to
# the ordinary startup recovery.
