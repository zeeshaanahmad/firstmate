#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-mail-check.sh - recurring received-mail poll as a standing watcher check.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-mail-check.sh [check]
#   fm-mail-check.sh arm
#   fm-mail-check.sh disarm
#   fm-mail-check.sh --help
#
# `check` runs the mail poll from this home (sourcing the same .env and using
# the same inbox state as fm-mail.sh itself). It composes with the existing
# watcher state-check contract instead of needing a schedule of its own: a
# printed line becomes a `check:` wake so firstmate can drain durable
# `check: mail <uid>` rows the poll already queued.
#
# `arm` writes state/mail.check.sh and binds its bytes with
# fm-check-register.sh, so the watcher dispatches it on its normal
# FM_CHECK_INTERVAL cadence and turns its one line into a `check:` wake.
# `disarm` removes the shim, its trust binding, and the report record.
#
# Mail configuration is read from the home's own .env by the poll, so arming
# needs no configuration of its own. A home that is armed before its .env has
# FM_MAIL_USER, FM_MAIL_PASS, FM_IMAP_HOST, and FM_SMTP_HOST is reported once
# for the missing value until the .env is fixed, which makes a partially
# configured channel a wake instead of a silent gap.
#
# Reporting keeps state/.mail-check as the news key, but prints whenever
# the poll is not a proven no-op. A proven no-op is a repeated identical
# line, not a timeout, with no publication evidence. Publication evidence
# is a timeout, fail-closed-after-queue diagnostics, a queued mail: check
# key, or growth of state/.mail-woken. Same-line silence is only for a
# proven no-op: successful poll with no new mail, or a repeated pre-wake
# failure (missing env, connection refused before wake_for, missing
# python3, missing fm-mail.sh, heal could not record a uid) that cannot
# have queued mail. Fail-closed after a queued wake and timeout always
# doorbell.
#
# The poll must finish inside the watcher's per-check bound
# (FM_CHECK_TIMEOUT, default 30, read from this check's own environment
# because the watcher runs it as a direct child). The internal budget
# FM_MAIL_CHECK_BUDGET (default 15, valid 5..25) is cut down to whatever fits
# inside that bound before the poll starts. A poll that does not finish is a
# real condition, so the budget is enforced rather than assumed: a timed-out
# poll reports one line naming the budget instead of leaving the check silent.

  fm-mail-check.sh arm       write and register state/mail.check.sh
  fm-mail-check.sh disarm    remove the check shim, its trust binding, and the record

Mail configuration (FM_MAIL_USER, FM_MAIL_PASS, FM_IMAP_HOST, FM_SMTP_HOST,
FM_IMAP_PORT, FM_SMTP_PORT) is read from <FM_HOME>/.env by fm-mail.sh.
