# ONE owner for the no-mistakes run-attribution primitives used by
# fm-crew-state.sh (read-only current-state reporting) and fm-teardown.sh
# (pre-teardown run abort, see its "Fix 1" header comment). Both bind a run
# by strict branch-and-head identity first, and both then recognize a provable
# pipeline-owned continuation through fm_nm_runs_status_for_worktree below:
# crew-state for an ACTIVE run, so a fix round never reads as an older failed
# run, and teardown for a run PARKED at a gate, so cleanup concludes it
# instead of orphaning it. Getting this wrong in either
# direction is unsafe: a false negative hides a genuinely parked run, and a
# false positive lets teardown act on a run it does not own.

# this repo shells out to under a read deadline - originally hardcoded to
# `no-mistakes` (fm_nm_run_bounded below still is, for compatibility), then

# 0 if run head $2 is consistent with worktree $1 owning an IN-FLIGHT run.
#
# fm_nm_head_matches_worktree above answers a question about code that is
# already in hand, and rejects a head it cannot resolve. That is right for its
# callers - teardown must never act on a run it cannot prove it owns - but it is
# wrong for a liveness read, because a running pipeline's head is routinely
# unresolvable here: no-mistakes commits its fixes in its own gate repo and does
# not push them until the push step, so from the first auto-fix round until then
# `axi status` reports a commit this object store has never seen. Requiring it to
# resolve makes a healthy run indistinguishable from a dead one for the whole
# review step, which is exactly the period the read exists to cover.
#
# So resolvability selects the question rather than deciding the answer:
#   - not a commit-ish token: reject, so prose or a truncated read can never be
#     mistaken for the unresolvable case below
#   - unreadable worktree: reject, so a broken checkout is never read as in-flight
#   - head resolves here: apply the strict rule above unchanged, which still
#     rejects a run validating superseded or rewritten code
#   - head does not resolve here: accept as a pipeline commit not yet pushed
#
# Accepting the unresolvable case does NOT weaken attribution, because it is not
# what binds the run to the task. `axi status` resolves its repo from the
# invoking directory and refuses outright outside a registered one, and within a
# repo git allows a branch to be checked out by only one worktree, so the
# caller's branch match is what proves ownership. This function's remaining job
# is to reject a run on that branch that is not the current work, and it keeps
# doing that whenever the head is resolvable. Callers must still bound liveness
# on the run's own non-terminal state and dated activity.

# 0 if run head $2 binds a run in state $3 with outcome $4 to worktree $1.
#
# The two rules above answer different questions, and picking between them is
# itself part of attribution, so the choice lives here rather than at each call
# site. A TERMINAL run must prove its head: its fixes were pushed at the push
# step, so an unresolvable head means the run is not this worktree's work, and a
# terminal verdict is exactly the evidence that would justify tearing down or
# restarting. An IN-FLIGHT run must not be required to, for the reason
# fm_nm_head_allows_inflight documents: from the first auto-fix round until the
# push step the reported head exists only in no-mistakes' own gate repository,
# so demanding resolution rejects every run between those two points.
#
# That window is not an edge case. It spans the review, test, document, and lint
# steps, which is where a run parks at awaiting_approval or fix_review, so a
# strict-only reader loses attribution for precisely the state supervision must
# surface and falls back to the pane - reporting a crew waiting at a gate as
# working, or as unknown when its pane is quiet.
#
# In-flight is an ALLOW-LIST of the run states no-mistakes actually reports for a
# live run, so the loosening can never widen on its own: a state this list does
# not name (including an empty one, and any terminal or gate value invented
# later) keeps the strict proof. tests/fm-nm-status-shape-live-e2e.test.sh is the
