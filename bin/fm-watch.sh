#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Firstmate watcher.
# Classifies supervision wakes in bash. In normal mode it absorbs benign wakes
# and keeps blocking; it queues and exits only for actionable wakes.
# The no-verb signal and stale path is absorb-only-on-positive-evidence: a wake
# is absorbed only when the crew shows it is still working through an actively
# running no-mistakes step or a backend busy signal. A home that opts in with
# config/turnend-churn-absorb lets a bare turn-end also use bounded pane churn
# since the previous poll. Every other no-verb wake surfaces, so a crew
# that finishes (or stops and waits) is never silently swallowed. A declared wait,
# either a paused: external wait or a verified captain-held transfer, is the
# separate idle absorb case and re-surfaces only on its long bounded cadence,
# although its initial no-verb status signal still surfaces in normal mode.
# That cadence is hours long and condition-aware: a paused: line naming
# `until <UTC ISO 8601>` is rechecked when that time passes, but a declared time
# beyond FM_PAUSE_RESURFACE_SECS cannot extend the ordinary recheck cadence, and
# while the away-posture record (state/.afk-contract) exists an
# item held for the captain is never rechecked at all, in either posture.
# While state/.afk exists, the daemon owns triage and this watcher queues and exits
# on every wake. Printed reason lines:
#   signal: <file>...      status/turn-end signals, surfaced when a listed status
#                          span has a captain-relevant event OR a no-verb signal lacks
#                          positive execution evidence, unless afk is active
#   stale: <window>        a provably-working stale is ALWAYS absorbed (with a wedge
#                          timer) regardless of what the status log says - an active
#                          run-step or busy pane outranks even a captain-relevant log
#                          line, since the crew's own log gets no new entry once
#                          firstmate hands it to a no-mistakes validation. A declared
#                          external-wait pause or verified captain-held transfer is
#                          absorbed instead with its own long re-surface cadence,
#                          never as a wedge, and that recheck reason names which
#                          human the wait is on. Only when neither absorb class
#                          applies does the log's latest recognized status event decide:
#                          terminal (captain-relevant) or non-terminal (no verb),
#                          both surfaced at once. A provably-working stale past the
#                          wedge threshold also surfaces, with an "escalation N"
#                          count in the reason; at FM_WEDGE_DEMAND_INSPECT_COUNT
#                          consecutive escalations on the SAME pane, the reason
#                          also carries a "demand-deep-inspection" marker so the
#                          wake payload itself, not just repetition, forces a
#                          closer look instead of another routine supervision
#                          resume. Unless afk is active. A pane about to escalate
#                          that can account for its quiet - a `paused:` external
#                          wait or a verified `captain-held` transfer its worker
#                          declared, or, where config/wedge-defer-parked-gate
#                          arms it, a validation gate of its own awaiting a
#                          supervisor decision nobody has answered yet - is
#                          deferred to that same long recheck cadence instead
#                          (wedge_wait_evidence), and a pane whose own task
#                          worktree was written during the quiet window is
#                          deferred rather than escalated (wedge_defer_writing),
#                          because files appearing there are liveness the pane and
#                          the run step cannot show; that deferral still
#                          re-surfaces once per PAUSE_RESURFACE_SECS, and a pane
#                          that writes nothing keeps the unchanged schedule.
#                          A pane whose recorded endpoint holds no agent at all is
#                          not a wedge and is reported ONCE instead of escalating
#                          on that cadence forever (wedge_dead_record); only the
#                          two recovery-grade verdicts license it, and every other
#                          verdict escalates unchanged.
#                          A genuinely busy pane
#                          (window_is_busy true) is exempt from the above, but
#                          only up to BUSY_TURN_MAX_SECS with no completed turn
#                          (state/<id>.turn-ended, or the spawn record before any
#                          turn completes). Past that bound, a declared external
#                          wait or verified captain-held transfer uses the long
#                          pause recheck cadence; under daemon-backed afk an
#                          external wait is instead handed to the daemon as this
#                          plain reason once per declaration, while captain-held
#                          work stays silent until return
#                          (busy_turn_bound_check owns that split);
#                          every other pane goes through the same wedge timer,
#                          the dead-record probe above included, and surfaces
#                          with the identical "stale: ..." reason, escalation
#                          count, and demand-deep-inspection marker for a live
#                          agent, for human inspection only - never an automatic
#                          interrupt, signal, or restart of the worker or its

# Busy state is decided by the semantic contract in bin/fm-busy-lib.sh, which
# is the single owner of per-harness sources, source attribution, and the one
# remaining rendered-text fallback (Grok only).
# Always-on wake triage: most wakes during a long crew validation are benign (a
# working: note or turn-end while a pipeline runs, a no-change heartbeat). Rather
# than wake firstmate's LLM for each, this watcher classifies every wake in bash
# and ABSORBS the benign majority - it advances the suppression marker, logs to a
# debug log, and keeps blocking WITHOUT enqueuing or exiting. The no-verb signal
# / stale path is absorb-only-on-positive-evidence. The shared proof is an actively
# running no-mistakes step or a busy pane via crew_is_provably_working over
# fm-crew-state.sh; where config/turnend-churn-absorb opts in, a bare turn-end alone
# may also use bounded pane churn since the previous poll.
# Every other crew that stopped its turn is SURFACED, so a finish reported
# only through interactive pane menus (no done: status) is never swallowed. An
# ACTIONABLE wake (a captain-relevant signal, a no-verb signal without either
# eligible proof, any check, a stale pane whose crew is not provably working, a
# provably-working stale past the threshold, or anything unknown) is written to
# the durable queue and exits. That wakes the LLM through the background-task
# completion. The same classifier
# (fm-classify-lib.sh) backs the away-mode daemon; while state/.afk exists the
# daemon owns triage, so this watcher reverts to one-shot (enqueue + exit on every
# wake) and never double-triages - and never runs the costly provably-working read.

# STALE_ESCALATE_SECS-paced wedge_timer_check used for a provably-working
# non-busy stale - so it escalates via the existing stale reason, escalation
# counter, and demand-deep-inspection marker for human inspection only, never an
# automatic interrupt, signal, or restart - unless the crew declared the wait

# 0 (benign/absorb) if EVERY task in a no-verb "signal:" wake has positive work
# evidence; 1 otherwise. Each task may satisfy the authoritative working proof,
# or an eligible bare turn-end may use the opt-in pane-churn proof below.
#
# OFF unless the home creates config/turnend-churn-absorb. The first two proofs
# read a verdict the harness itself vouches for; this one infers execution from
# rendered bytes, which is weaker, so widening the absorb is a home's choice to
# make rather than a default every fleet inherits. With the flag absent this
# delegates to the unchanged all-tasks authoritative proof.
#
# It exists because the first two are unreachable for a harness whose semantic
# busy state has no verified source: bin/fm-crew-state.sh can only answer unknown
# for such an adapter, crew_is_provably_working is therefore never satisfiable,
# and every worker turn boundary surfaced a wake with nothing to act on - the cost
# scaling with the number of workers in flight. Pane churn needs no harness
# cooperation, so it restores the absorb branch for those adapters without
# fabricating a busy verdict any adapter has not earned.
#
# The evidence is the one the pane-staleness backbone below already trusts for
# liveness: this compares a fresh capture against the .hash- marker that backbone
# recorded on the previous poll, which is why the derivation lives here with the
# marker format rather than in the shared classifier. Absorbing here DEFERS a wake
# rather than swallowing it, and the deferral is BOUNDED: a task's turn-ends may
# ride churn evidence for at most FM_TURNEND_CHURN_ABSORB_SECS, tracked per window
# in .churn-since-, after which the wake surfaces and the window restarts. The
# bound is what keeps churn from muting supervision outright. A pane that renders
# continuously - a clock, a spinner, a shell heartbeat, a harness that leaves a
# background renderer alive after its agent yields - never presents the two
# identical consecutive hashes the staleness backbone needs either, so without the
# bound a worker that had genuinely stopped behind such a renderer would be
# deferred here forever with no fallback path left to surface it. Churn and
# staleness read the same pane, so neither can be the other's only backstop.
# Within the bound, an ordinary crew that stops renders nothing more, its pane
# hash stops moving, and the staleness backbone surfaces it within a couple of
# polls; any captain-relevant status verb still surfaces immediately through
# signal_files_actionable. That is why this widens the proof instead of
# bounding the wake rate, which would have suppressed genuinely stopped workers.
#
# Every negative outcome returns 1, so absence of evidence surfaces exactly as
# before: any batch that references a secondmate, an unresolvable task, a task
# with no uniquely attributable recorded endpoint, no previous hash to compare
# against (nothing has been polled yet), a capture that fails or comes back empty,
# an exhausted deferral bound, and of course an unchanged pane. Any .status file
# also returns 1: an authored append is content the
# supervisor may need to read, so only the mechanical turn-end marker gets the
# fallback.
#
# NOT a pure read: one bounded pane capture per referenced task that lacks
# authoritative proof. Once EVERY task passes, each churn-proven pane's prior
# .stale- classification and wedge-escalation count are cleared because churn
# begins a new quiet interval; retaining either would make the new interval
# inherit the prior one. Reached only for a non-afk, no-captain-verb signal, so
# it never runs on the ordinary per-wake path.

# The evidence that a quiet pane is a BOUNDED WAIT rather than a wedge suspect,
# read at the one moment it decides anything: when an escalation is about to
# fire. Two records answer it, and they are independent: the worker's own status
# line - a declared `paused:` external wait, or a verified `captain-held`
# transfer - and, when that line explains nothing, the crew's authoritative
# current state.
#
# The generated brief promises that declaring one buys the long recheck cadence
# instead of a wedge, and the wedge timer is reachable while that declaration
# stands: a crew that declares a wait and then has an active run or busy pane
# attributed to it is handed to the timer as provably-working, and the timer then
# escalates on elapsed idle time alone. The declaration is what the worker said
# about its OWN silence, so it outranks a liveness verdict that only says
# something is running.
#
# A declared clearing time that has ALREADY passed (`paused: ... until <t>`) is
# not evidence: the wait the worker described is over, so it no longer explains
# the silence, and the pane keeps the unchanged schedule. The records are read in
# this order rather than pooled because the routing already guarantees it is the
# right one: a pane whose last line is `paused:` or `captain-held:` reaches this
# timer only through pause_state_class answering `working`, so its crew state is
# a running step, never a parked gate.
#
# The second record is OFF unless the home creates config/wedge-defer-parked-gate,
# and that one guard is what makes an unconfigured home's behaviour identical to
# having no second record at all: it is read before the fold, so no fold or
# crew-state read is spent, no wait record exists to defer on, no recheck wording
# is reachable, and the lane keeps the unchanged escalation schedule, reason and
# demand-deep-inspection wording. Unlike the status line, which is the worker's
# own declaration about its own silence, this record is derived from a pipeline's
# gate state, so which lanes lose the ladder for it is a home's choice to make
# rather than a default every fleet inherits - the same reason
# config/turnend-churn-absorb gates its own widened absorb.
#
# The second record takes TWO signals, and needs both. The crew's authoritative
# current state must be a no-mistakes gate whose answer is owed by a HUMAN
# (crew_gate_awaits_human_decision in fm-classify-lib.sh, minted from the
# findings table's `action` column by position), AND the task's own decision fold
# must still hold an open `needs-decision` record whose key is `nm-<run>-<step>`
# for the run that verdict reports. The gate's table alone says only that the
# answer is owed by a human; the open decision bound to that run is the positive
# evidence that firstmate was actually told about THIS gate and has not answered
# yet, which is what makes the lane's quiet a wait rather than a suspected wedge.
# An open decision under any other key - an unrelated question never closed - is
# not that evidence, and neither is a verdict that names no run. The wait is owed
# by firstmate, not the captain: ask-user findings are routed to firstmate, which
# decides most of them itself, and one it escalates becomes a captain-held
# transfer that the first record above already catches. So the away-posture
# silence does not apply to it: under away posture the supervision branch is the
# actor allowed to answer it, and it is rechecked on the long cadence throughout.
# The two signals come apart in both directions, and the ladder is kept in each:
#   - the decision was ANSWERED and the crewmate has not yet relayed it with
#     `axi respond`: the gate is still reported parked and still carries the
#     ask-user row, but `fm-send --resolve-key` wrote the closing `resolved` line
#     at answer time, so the fold is empty and what is outstanding is the
#     crewmate's OWN next move;
#   - the crewmate parked at a human-owed gate and went quiet before escalating
#     it at all: nobody was ever told, so there is no wait to defer to.
# A `blocked` record does not count: a blocker is not an unanswered gate decision
# and a different action clears it. A gate awaiting the CREWMATE's own answer is
# deliberately NOT evidence either: a crewmate that goes quiet before answering
# its own gate is exactly the wedge this ladder exists to catch, so those keep
# the unchanged schedule, reason and demand-deep-inspection wording.
# Nothing here weakens detection for a pane with no wait at all - their
# escalation schedule, reason and wording are untouched, and every way this
# signal can come back empty (an unreadable status file, a fold with nothing
# open, a key convention nobody followed) escalates on the unchanged schedule
# rather than losing the ladder. The status-line and fold reads are file reads;
# the crew-state read is the costly one (it may make a bounded no-mistakes call),

# Defer ONE wedge escalation for a pane whose wait record explains the quiet
# (wedge_wait_evidence above). Deliberately the same shape as
# wedge_defer_writing: a DEFERRAL, not a cancellation, so the idle timer restarts
# and the next window probes the evidence again - a wait that ends is escalating
# again within one STALE_ESCALATE_SECS, which is why the worst-case detection
# time for a pane that stops waiting does not move.
# Every word of the recheck that could be wrong per kind of evidence - the human
# it names, the action it asks for, the age it publishes - is READ FROM THE
# RECORD rather than re-derived here, so this function cannot word one kind of
# wait as another.
# A wait with a written record is aged from that file, which is when the worker
# wrote the line - anchored there rather than on a per-window marker for the same
# reason handle_paused_stale is: an idle pane churns its display (a clock, a
# token counter), and a marker this deferral kept touching would let that churn
# reset the cadence. A wait with NO written record publishes no age at all: the
# quiet window is the only clock in hand and this deferral resets it on every
# pass, so a number read from it would never grow and would tell a supervisor
# that a day-old gate opened four minutes ago. The bounded re-surface still
# fires, governed by its own throttle instead of by a wait age.
# A CAPTAIN-facing wait is not rechecked at all while the away-posture record
# exists: the one human who can answer it is away, the return brief already lists
# it, and every other captain-facing path in this file absorbs it silently for
# that reason (handle_paused_stale, surface_nonterminal_stale,
# captain_call_stale_bound). That absorb arms no throttle and deliberately
# leaves the idle timer alone: a `captain` whom is minted only by the
# captain-held arm of wedge_wait_evidence, which returns before the
# wedge-defer-parked-gate flag test and therefore before any decision-fold or
# current-state read, so the only read that repeats under the away record is the
# one status-line read that predates this deferral. There is nothing costly to
# throttle there, so the recheck owed on return stays owed in full the moment the
# record is archived rather than starting a cadence nobody could act on. The
# costly parked-gate consult is owed to the supervisor instead, never silenced
# here, and its own deferral restarts the timer below.
# The escalation counter is left alone, exactly as the write deferral leaves it:
# this is not an escalation, and a later genuine one must keep the
# demand-inspection history it had already earned.

# The question the wedge timer never asked before it alarmed: is there still an

# re-alarming it earns its cost; an agent that is gone never moves again, its pane
# never churns, the idle timer never resets, and the escalate path below clears its
# own timer and re-arms with nothing bounding the count.
# docs/architecture.md owns that contract and why only these two verdicts license
# it; what the code needs stated here is the rest.
#
# fm_backend_agent_state (bin/fm-backend.sh) owns the vocabulary and the
# process-level proof behind it. Every verdict short of proof - `alive`,
# `ambiguous`, `unreadable`, `unverified`, or a read that failed outright - keeps
# the unchanged escalation schedule, reason and count, so this narrows WHICH panes
# escalate and never how loudly the ones that still do.
#
# Deliberately NOT a deferral like the two above it. They restart the idle timer
# because the pane might still be working; this is terminal for as long as the
# endpoint stays gone, because there is nothing left to re-probe on a cadence and a
# repeat is exactly the noise it exists to stop. WHICH verdict fired is named for
# the same reason wedge_wait_evidence names its kind of wait: the two ask the supervisor
# for different things.
#
# The marker is owned entirely by this function and records the verdict together
# with the agent incarnation it was reported for: the task's per-incarnation busy
# gen (bin/fm-busy-lib.sh, state/<id>.busy-gen), which changes exactly when the
# agent is replaced, so a repeat is absorbed only while BOTH still match, a read
# that stops being gone still drops it, and no other reset site has to know this
# file exists. The incarnation half re-arms a relaunch: a successor's own later
# death is reported in full even when its dead display hashes identically to the
# reported one. Only when no incarnation token is readable for the task does the
# pane hash stand in as the discriminator - an unreadable token must never mean
# re-report on every threshold, so that fallback keeps today's hash-keyed absorb,
# with the residual that a record-less successor dying into a byte-identical dead
# display stays absorbed. Under one unchanged incarnation a dead pane's static
# display absorbs on every threshold either way.

# The two records of one ordinary crew wait, and why its stale alarm reads both.
#
# status_is_paused_or_captain_held reads the status LINE a worker wrote, which is
# the only record when the worker itself is waiting. It is not the only record
# there is: once firstmate hands work to the captain, the wait is written into the
# BACKLOG by bin/fm-captain-hold.sh, and the worker's last line stays whatever it
# was - routinely `done` after a PR delivery, which no line predicate can
# read as a wait. An alarm bounded only by the line therefore re-fires for the
# captain's whole thinking time, on exactly the work they already have in hand.
#
# `open` is that record's own read-only predicate and owns its semantics: exit 0
# still an open captain call, 1 not, 2 could not be established. Only a 0 bounds
# an alarm here, so an unreadable backlog, an incompatible or absent tasks-axi,
# and a row this home does not carry all keep alarming exactly as they do today -
# a wait this watcher cannot prove is not a wait.
#
# The read costs one subprocess and runs only where the watcher is about to
# alarm, so at most once per distinct stale hash per window, beside the crew-state
# read the same paths already pay. The secondmate stale gate deliberately runs
# before this bound and admits only status-declared waits: a backlog-only hold
# whose mate still says `working:` or `done:` does not reach this read. Reaching
# it would put backlog reads into windows deliberately skipped on ordinary polls.

#
# So a legitimate wait bounds this path to the same once-per-PAUSE_RESURFACE_SECS

# Side-band ledger publication, detached from the poll loop.

# beacon's freshness as proof that supervision is alive. Publication is a
# side-band nicety bounded by FM_HOME_SUMMARY_TIMEOUT, but that bound is far
# larger than one poll and, in a home whose publication keeps failing, it is
# paid on every poll - so running it inline puts up to a full publication
# deadline between two beacon touches and can starve the guard's grace. Nothing
# in the poll depends on the ledger, so start it and move on: the beacon keeps
# advancing no matter how slow the publication is.
#
# The trade the detachment makes: a reader can briefly see a ledger that
# predates the event this poll just surfaced, where the inline call published
# first. Publication is eventually consistent by design and every reader
# re-derives current state from the owning home anyway, while beacon freshness
# is what the whole supervision chain rests on.

    #     decision, or wedged. Absorbing such a turn-end is exactly the
    #     swallowed-finish this change guards against.
    # Positive evidence is either an authoritative provably-working verdict or, in a
