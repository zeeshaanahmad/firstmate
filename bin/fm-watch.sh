#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Firstmate watcher.
# Classifies supervision wakes in bash. In normal mode it absorbs benign wakes
# and keeps blocking; it queues and exits only for actionable wakes.
# The no-verb signal and stale path is absorb-only-when-provably-working: a wake
# is absorbed only when the crew shows POSITIVE evidence it is still working (an
# actively-running no-mistakes step, or a backend busy signal), and surfaced
# otherwise, so a crew that finishes (or stops and waits) without a current
# working signal is never silently swallowed. A declared external-wait pause is
# the separate idle absorb case and re-surfaces only on its long bounded cadence,
# although its initial no-verb status signal still surfaces in normal mode.
# While state/.afk exists, the daemon owns triage and this watcher queues and exits
# on every wake. Printed reason lines:
#   signal: <file>...      status/turn-end signals, surfaced when a listed status
#                          has a captain-relevant verb OR a no-verb signal's crew
#                          is not provably working, unless afk is active
#   stale: <window>        a provably-working stale is ALWAYS absorbed (with a wedge
#                          timer) regardless of what the status log says - an active
#                          run-step or busy pane outranks even a captain-relevant log
#                          line, since the crew's own log gets no new entry once
#                          firstmate hands it to a no-mistakes validation. A declared
#                          external-wait pause is absorbed instead with its own long
#                          re-surface cadence, never as a wedge. Only when neither
#                          absorb class applies does the log's last line decide:
#                          terminal (captain-relevant) or non-terminal (no verb),
#                          both surfaced at once. A provably-working stale past the
#                          wedge threshold also surfaces, with an "escalation N"
#                          count in the reason; at FM_WEDGE_DEMAND_INSPECT_COUNT
#                          consecutive escalations on the SAME pane, the reason
#                          also carries a "demand-deep-inspection" marker so the
#                          wake payload itself, not just repetition, forces a
#                          closer look instead of another routine supervision
#                          resume. Unless afk is active. A genuinely busy pane
#                          (window_is_busy true) is exempt from the above, but
#                          only up to BUSY_TURN_MAX_SECS with no completed turn
#                          (state/<id>.turn-ended, or the spawn record before any
#                          turn completes); past that bound busy_turn_over_age
#                          routes it through the same wedge timer, so it surfaces
#                          with the identical "stale: ..." reason, escalation
#                          count, and demand-deep-inspection marker, for human

# working: note or turn-end while a pipeline runs, a no-change heartbeat). Rather
# than wake firstmate's LLM for each, this watcher classifies every wake in bash
# and ABSORBS the benign majority - it advances the suppression marker, logs to a

# / stale path is absorb-only-when-provably-working: such a wake is absorbed ONLY
# while the crew shows positive evidence it is still working (an actively-running
# no-mistakes step, or a busy pane, via crew_is_provably_working over
# fm-crew-state.sh); a crew that stopped its turn with no running pipeline and no
# busy pane is SURFACED, so a finish reported only through interactive pane menus
# (no done: status) is never swallowed. An ACTIONABLE wake (a captain-relevant
# signal, a no-verb signal whose crew is not provably working, any check, a stale
# pane whose crew is not provably working, a provably-working stale past the
# threshold, or anything unknown) is written to the durable queue and exits, which
# is what wakes the LLM through the background-task completion. The same classifier
# (fm-classify-lib.sh) backs the away-mode daemon; while state/.afk exists the
