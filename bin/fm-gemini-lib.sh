# Why one owner: the Gemini CLI ships as a node bundle, so a live gemini pane
# presents as an interpreter and nothing about its command NAME says gemini.
# Measured on gemini-cli 0.58.0 with Node v24.20.0 on Linux, one worker's
# foreground process group read:
#
#   comm  : MainThread
#   argv0 : /home/<user>/.local/node/bin/node
#   args  : node /home/<user>/.local/bin/gemini -y
#
# `comm` is MainThread because modern Node renames its main thread, and argv[0]
# is the interpreter. Only argv[1] - the script path - carries the identity, so
# the liveness classifier has to read the arguments rather than the name. This
# is the same hazard bin/fm-cursor-lib.sh exists to close for cursor-agent, and
# the rule here is deliberately the same shape: structural only, no subprocess,
# because probing a stranger's binary during a liveness poll is exactly what
# must not happen.
#
# Detection of firstmate's OWN harness uses these structural rules for the
# ancestry fallback. The GEMINI_CLI=1 environment marker in bin/fm-harness.sh
# remains the load-bearing path for the installed bundle shape on modern Node.

# True when path $1 carries Gemini's own structural evidence: the file is named
# gemini, or it sits inside the published @google/gemini-cli package tree. A
# directory component merely named `gemini` is never enough on its own, and a
