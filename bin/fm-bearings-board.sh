#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fm-bearings-board.sh - build and arm the /bearings lavish fleet board.
#
# The board is the captain-facing interactive surface of /bearings lavish: the
# shipped template (.agents/skills/bearings/assets/board-template.html) plus one
# injected fm-bearings-board.v1 JSON payload. This script owns the mechanics so
# the invoking agent's per-run work stays "compose the JSON, run build" - the
# agent never authors board UI at invocation time.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-bearings-board.sh build <data.json>
#   fm-bearings-board.sh path
#
# build      Validate the payload, drop the Captain's Call cards whose subject
#            already landed, give every surviving decision card the standard
#            reconcile choice, and inject the result into a fresh copy of the
#            shipped template at the stable board path. Establish the Lavish
#            session on that board and PROVE it is live BEFORE binding and
#            arming its answer source, so a registered poll can never race a
#            session that does not exist or attach to one that has ended.
#            Bind to the keyed-answer intake (bin/fm-captain-hold.sh) ALWAYS
#            precedes arm, so the board can never produce an answer that has
#            nowhere to go (captain-hold-lifecycle's ordering rule, enforced
#            here rather than left to agent memory). Output starts with
#            `board: <path>`, then includes lavish-axi's session output and
#            the remaining status:
#              session: live | reopened
#              served: <path>
#              bound: <source-id>
#              armed: <source-id>            (first registration)
#              already-armed: <source-id>    (registration already present)
#              listening: <owner>            (only when a replacement was needed)
#            Every dropped card is named on stderr as a `dropped-landed-card:`
#            line, so a rebuild states what it removed instead of quietly
#            shrinking Captain's Call.
# path       Print the stable board path for this home.
#
# A LIVE SESSION IS PROVED, NEVER ASSUMED. `lavish-axi <file>` exits 0 even
# when it refuses to reopen a session the captain ended from the browser,
# reporting `status: user-ended` with the same session id, so exit status alone
# cannot tell a live board from a dead one. build requires the server's fresh
# session listing to show the canonical board open and refuses rather than
# arming an ended session. After a reopen it retires the pre-reopen source
# generation through the guarded adapter path, arms a fresh registration, and
# accepts only the replacement listener as live. A registered board with no
# live owner also gets a replacement before build returns, because
# `already-armed` is not the same fact as `listening`.
#
# CAPTAIN'S CALL HYGIENE. A decision card is dropped when its work item, PR, or
# structured artifact/version subject appears among the payload's own landed
# rows, or when `bin/fm-captain-hold.sh open` reports the task is no longer an
# open captain call. A newer published version also supersedes a version card.
# A task whose state cannot be established is kept, because a call wrongly
# hidden is worse than a card wrongly shown. Cleanup is therefore a normal
# rebuild effect rather than a committed migration or direct state mutation.
#
# THE RECONCILE CHOICE. Every decision card carries the standard `reconcile`
# option, injected here so the guarantee does not depend on the composer's
# memory, and the payload validator reserves that value across every card type.
# The validator's reservation scope must equal the adapter's reconcile
# classification scope, which is all card types because the captured payload
# carries no card type. Its meaning, and the reason it can never reach the
# keyed-answer intake as a blind close, are owned by
# docs/captain-hold-lifecycle.md.
#
# Validation is fail-closed: the payload must be valid JSON with
# schema=fm-bearings-board.v1 and every renderer-consumed field must satisfy
# the fm-bearings-board.v1 types and item invariants below. Every fleet row and
# Captain's Call item explicitly carries `repo`; the composer fills it from the
# snapshot and task records wherever known, and uses null or an empty string
# only as the deliberate genuinely-no-repo marker. In that exceptional case
# the template may display the routing id. Anything else refuses before the
# existing board is touched.
#
# The board path is stable - $FM_HOME/.lavish/bearings-board.html - so a
# re-invocation rebuilds the same file in place, which keeps the same Lavish
# session URL and the same canonical process-event source id. Injection escapes
# every `<` in the compact JSON as the \u003c string escape, so a payload string
# containing "</script>" can never terminate the data block early.
#
# FM_BEARINGS_BOARD_TEMPLATE overrides the shipped template path (tests only).
